a2f8ac4 Add Context Profile Builder MVP
f3a2295 Initial commit from Create Next App
```

## Current State

**MVP is functional.** Web app for creating Context Profile Framework documents using single-page questionnaires with research pre-fill and Claude-powered synthesis.

The Company Background document flow works end-to-end:
- User signs up, verifies email, logs in
- Creates organization with company name and website
- Website is analyzed via Jina Reader + Claude to extract company info
- Pre-filled questionnaire for Company Background
- Claude generates the document
- User can download, save as draft, or mark complete

**Tech stack:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase, shadcn/ui, Claude API, Jina Reader

## Recent Work

Built the complete MVP in a single session:
- Full auth flow with Supabase (signup, email verification, login)
- Organization onboarding with website research
- Company Background questionnaire with AI pre-fill from website
- Document generation using Claude API
- Document preview with download button
- Dashboard showing 4 document cards
- Export all documents as ZIP

Also resolved several issues:
- Fixed RLS policy chicken-and-egg problem (temporarily disabled)
- Added toast notifications for loading states
- Fixed save button logic (no draft after complete)

## Open Items

**Immediate:**
- Add persistent loading indicator for document generation (user requested more visible than toast)
- Fix research status polling on dashboard
- Re-enable RLS with correct policies

**Soon:**
- Add questionnaires for ICP Definition, Competitor Intelligence, Brand Voice
- Proper markdown rendering in preview
- Generate proper Supabase types

**Future:**
- Deploy to Vercel
- Test with real users/clients
