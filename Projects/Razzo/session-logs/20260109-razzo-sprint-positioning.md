# Razzo Website: Sprint as Go-To-Market Focus

**Date:** January 9, 2026

## Strategic Context: Sprint as Go-To-Market Focus

**Key Business Insight:** The AI Workflow Sprint is evolving from a complementary offering into the primary go-to-market focus for Razzo. This represents a fundamental shift in positioning—away from "training company" toward "workflow enablement company."

### Why the Sprint is Different

**The Core Problem It Solves:** Teams get stuck between scattered individual AI experimentation and systematic adoption. Traditional training (even 4-week bootcamps) has a "knowing-doing gap"—people learn skills but don't apply them systematically. The Sprint bridges this gap through action learning: participants build real working tools, not just learn features.

**What Makes It Effective:**
- **Immediate deliverables:** Teams leave with working workflows they can use immediately (not just skills to apply later)
- **Identifies champions:** The sprint naturally surfaces team members with AI aptitude who can lead future initiatives
- **Creates shared language:** Documented workflows establish common frameworks across teams
- **Peer momentum:** Demo presentations and collaboration build accountability and excitement
- **Reveals skill gaps:** Hands-on building shows where deeper training (bootcamp) would be most valuable

### Positioning Strategy

**Sprint as Entry Point:** Position the Sprint as the natural first step for organizations, not as a secondary offering. It's lower risk (2 weeks vs 4), produces tangible deliverables, and creates organic pathways to additional services:
- Sprint → Bootcamp (if skill gaps revealed)
- Sprint → Additional sprints (quarterly building cycles)
- Sprint → Momentum Program (ongoing support)

**Implications for Site Messaging:**
- Don't lead with the "4-week methodology"—it's one option, not the main story
- Emphasize the action-learning approach and immediate results
- The 4-week bootcamp is valuable for deeper skill development but shouldn't overshadow the Sprint's appeal
- Avoid positioning training as "the solution"—position it as one tool in a portfolio

**Flexibility in Execution:** The Sprint works across formats:
- **Individual:** Up to 10 people each building their own workflow ($3,500)
- **Team:** 25-30 people organized into small teams collaborating to build shared workflows ($5,000)

### Philosophical Alignment

The Sprint reflects the reality of how professionals actually adopt tools: not through passive learning, but through solving real problems. It's why the SalesIntel engagement worked—three teams built three tools they'd actually use, presented them to the company, and created instant organizational awareness and adoption.

## What Was Done in This Session

Updated the Razzo website to reflect the Sprint-first positioning:

**Website Changes:**
- Created AI Workflow Sprint offering page with 3-session structure (Foundations & Planning, Build Techniques & Check-in, Demo & Presentations)
- Added pre-sprint survey for customization
- Implemented two-tier pricing: Individual ($3,500) and Team ($5,000) formats
- Positioned Sprint first in navigation dropdown
- Added to homepage course grid (3-column layout)

**Edits Made:**
- Removed "actually" from sales language (unnecessary filler)
- Clarified flexible group sizing (individuals OR teams)
- Emphasized "collaborating to build workflows" vs "shared workflows"
- Updated sidebar to show 3 sessions and pre-work survey
- Removed "Deliverables" sidebar item

**Pending Refinements:**
- Move Example Workflows section to bottom of page (currently too prominent)
- Add "Beyond the Workflows" benefits section highlighting champion identification
- Fix bullet font sizing (CSS)
- Soften language about 4-week training methodology on homepage/about
- Add featured Sprint section above course grid on homepage
- Reframe "training adoption" language to avoid positioning training as the problem

## Key Takeaways for Future Planning

1. **The Sprint is the story.** It's not a supporting offering—it's becoming the primary value proposition. All other offerings (bootcamp, momentum, governance) flow from Sprint success.

2. **Action beats instruction.** The fundamental insight is that professionals adopt tools by solving real problems, not by passive learning. This applies across all offerings.

3. **Natural upsell path.** The Sprint creates organic entry points to deeper engagement—teams discover skill gaps during building, creating demand for bootcamp training.

4. **De-emphasize methodology.** The 4-week format is less important than emphasizing outcomes and results. The Sprint works differently (2 weeks, tangible tools) but shouldn't feel like a downgrade.

5. **Benefits beyond training.** The Sprint delivers value beyond skill building: identifies leaders, creates shared frameworks, builds momentum. Highlighting these benefits differentiates it from traditional training.
