## What Changed

Major website update to position the AI Workflow Sprint as the primary go-to-market offering (not secondary to the bootcamp).

**Strategic Shift:** Moving from "training company" to "workflow enablement company." The Sprint is now the lead offering because it produces immediate tangible deliverables and creates natural pathways to other services.

**Website Updates:**
- Created dedicated AI Workflow Sprint offering page
- Positioned Sprint first in navigation
- Added to homepage course grid
- Implemented two-tier pricing: Individual ($3,500) and Team ($5,000)
- Documented 3-session structure with pre-sprint survey

**Pending refinements identified:**
- Move Example Workflows section to bottom
- Add "Beyond the Workflows" benefits section
- Soften 4-week methodology language throughout site
- Add featured Sprint section on homepage

## Key Strategic Insights

**Why the Sprint Works:**
- Bridges "knowing-doing gap" through action learning
- Teams leave with working workflows (not just skills)
- Naturally identifies AI champions
- Creates shared language and frameworks
- Reveals where deeper training would help

**Positioning Strategy:**
- Sprint as entry point (not bootcamp)
- Lower risk (2 weeks vs 4), tangible deliverables
- Organic pathways: Sprint → Bootcamp or Sprint → Additional sprints

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Professionals adopt tools by solving real problems, not through passive learning."

This insight applies across all Razzo offerings.
