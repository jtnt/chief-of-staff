## Recent Work

### Major Strategic Shift: Sprint-First Positioning

**What Changed:** Complete repositioning of the AI Workflow Sprint from a complementary offering to the primary go-to-market focus. The Sprint is now positioned as the natural entry point for organizations.

**Why It Matters:**
- Solves the "knowing-doing gap" - traditional training teaches skills but doesn't guarantee application
- Teams build working workflows they use immediately (not just learn features)
- Lower risk entry point ($3,500 vs $5,000) that creates organic pathways to additional services
- Naturally identifies team champions and reveals skill gaps that justify deeper training

**Recent Work:**

1. **Repository Reorganization (2026-01-09):**
   - Expanded from website-only to broader Razzo business repository
   - Split CLAUDE.md into root (project-wide), website-specific, and strategic context files
   - Created folder structure for Planning and Assets

2. **AI Workflow Sprint Launch (2026-01-09):**
   - Created full Sprint offering page with structure, pricing, example scenarios
   - Added Sprint to navigation (appears first in dropdown)
   - Converted homepage course grid from 2-column to 3-column to feature Sprint
   - Established pricing: $3,500 (individual format up to 10 people) or $5,000 (team format 25-30 people)

3. **Sprint Emphasis & De-emphasis of 4-Week Format (2026-01-09):**
   - Added featured Sprint section on homepage with "NEW OFFERING" badge
   - Softened "The 4-Week Advantage" section to "Structured Learning That Sticks"
   - Added "Beyond the Workflows" benefits section on Sprint page (identify champions, build institutional knowledge, etc.)
   - Reframed training criticism to be less negative: "Most teams get stuck between experimentation and systematic adoption"
   - Moved Example Workflows section to bottom of Sprint page
   - Updated About page to soften 4-week methodology emphasis

4. **Sales & Marketing Teams Positioning (2025-12-29):**
   - Shifted from sales-only to "Sales & Marketing Teams" to broaden appeal
   - Added Marketing Teams course to navigation and course listings
   - Maintained revenue focus (no Customer Success course yet)

## Open Items

**Sprint Page Refinements:**
- All pending TODO items completed (as of 2026-01-09)

**Strategic:**
- Continue monitoring whether Sprint positioning resonates with market
- Evaluate Sprint → Bootcamp conversion pathway effectiveness
- Consider quarterly sprint model for ongoing client engagement

**Technical:**
- Website deploys from contents of `website/` folder to web root
- Local dev runs server from inside `website/` folder
- SSI architecture for includes (see website/CLAUDE.md for details)
