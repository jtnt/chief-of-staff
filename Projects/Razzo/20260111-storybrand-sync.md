## Recent Work

**StoryBrand Framework Messaging Exploration (2026-01-11)**

Applied Donald Miller's StoryBrand PEACE framework to improve messaging and find a compelling "problem soundbite."

**The Core Problem Razzo Solves (Clarified):**
- Scattered AI usage across the team
- Some people killing it, some never using it
- No shared prompts or resources
- Nobody building repeatable workflows
- Nothing shared to compound effort and knowledge
- No systems, no frameworks

**Rejected Framings (and why):**
- "Nothing sticks" — too vague
- "AI knowledge trapped in individual accounts" — not how prospects see it
- "Shared AI playbook" — sounds like a deliverable document
- "We help teams build shared workflows" — sounds like building individual workflows
- "Everyone's doing their own thing with AI" — not something a VP lies awake about
- Anything implying "AI makes money" — AI doesn't drive revenue, teams do

**What Has Worked:** "AI training that drives revenue" — connects training to what sales/marketing teams actually do.

**Key Clarification:** Razzo trains sales and marketing teams to use AI effectively. When they use AI effectively, they're better at their jobs. Their jobs drive revenue.

**Closest Attempt:** "Your team is using AI, but not in a way that's moving the needle." — Close but not quite right.

**Also Updated:**
- Sprint page pricing: Team Format now $7,500 (was $5,000)
- Minor copy tweaks

## Open Items

- **UNRESOLVED:** Finding the right problem soundbite that:
  1. A VP of Sales or CMO immediately recognizes as their situation
  2. Creates urgency to act
  3. Connects to revenue outcomes
  4. Doesn't sound like jargon or a deliverable

- The soundbite needs to capture "scattered-to-systematic" in a way that resonates with buyers
