## Current State

The Context Profile Framework (CPF) is an R&D and thinking partner project for developing **Context Infrastructure**—the structured layer between an organization's scattered data sources and the AI tools that need that knowledge.

**Core insight:** Organizations need context systems that solve three problems:
1. **Creation friction** (primary barrier - where everything stalls)
2. **Maintenance burden** (keeping knowledge current)
3. **Access barriers** (getting context to the right people/tools)

The CPF provides the organizing structure for context infrastructure through four hierarchical layers:
- **Company Layer** - Company-wide knowledge (business model, ICP, brand voice)
- **Department Layer** - Team-specific playbooks (sales methodology, marketing campaigns)
- **Project Layer** - Initiative-specific context (client profiles, project status)
- **Individual Layer** - Role-specific knowledge (responsibilities, preferences)

The framework is implementation-agnostic—works whether delivered via Google Docs + Claude Projects (simple), MCP servers, APIs, or knowledge graph databases (advanced).

**Business context:** Part of Razzo's AI training business, targeting VP Sales/Marketing at B2B companies (25-250 employees, $5M-$25M revenue).

## Recent Work

### Major Conceptual Updates to Architecture (January 9, 2026)

Significant expansion of the Context Infrastructure architecture based on research into context graphs and decision traces:

**1. The Four-Layer Context Network**

Refined understanding of the middle layer between data sources and AI tools:
- **Knowledge Layer** - Raw facts, information, atomic concepts
- **Ontological Layer** - Relationships, what connects to what (WikiLinks, graph structure)
- **Reasoning Layer** - Purpose, the why behind connections
- **Precedent Layer** - Decision traces, actions taken, outcomes

**2. The "What vs. Why" Gap - Precedent Layer Detail**

Systems of record capture *what* happened (deal closed at 20% discount) but miss *why* it was allowed. Added concrete framework for four types of decision traces:

- **Exception logic that lives in heads** ("We always give healthcare companies 10% extra because procurement cycles are brutal")
- **Precedents from past decisions** ("Similar deal for Company X last quarter, should be consistent")
- **Cross-system synthesis** (Human connects Salesforce + Zendesk + Slack to make decision)
- **Approval chains outside structured systems** (Hallway thumbs-up from boss)

**3. Agents as Context Graph Builders**

Critical new insight: Agents don't just consume context—they **create decision traces by doing work**. Each agent action that routes an exception, synthesizes cross-system data, or gets approval adds to the precedent layer. Over time these traces form a queryable graph where the "why" becomes first-class data.

Example: Renewal agent proposes 20% discount (policy caps at 10%). Agent pulls SEV1 incidents from PagerDuty, escalation in Zendesk, prior approval thread. Routes to finance, gets approval. CRM records "20% discount" but context graph records why it was allowed, what precedent it creates, who approved, what data informed the decision.

**4. Discovery vs. Pre-definition**

New tension identified: Traditional knowledge graphs fail because they require pre-defining structure upfront. Context graphs can invert this—agents act as "informed walkers" discovering organizational ontology through use. Thousands of agent walks reveal organizational schema from actual usage patterns rather than predetermined assumptions.

This surfaces "policy in practice" vs. "stated policy" (e.g., if the exception happens every time, it's not actually an exception—it's the real rule).

**5. Human Role Evolution**

As agents handle execution work, human roles shift from doing tasks to managing context that enables agent autonomy:
- Providing oversight and escalation paths
- Coordinating work between agents (like managers coordinate teams)
- Making judgment calls that break patterns and create new precedents
- Shepherding work and ensuring context flows correctly

Decision traces—the most uniquely human part of work—become the critical input to agent effectiveness. Context engineering becomes change management.

**6. Context as Competitive Advantage**

When everyone has access to the same AI models, context quality becomes differentiation. The clarity of your ICP, decision traces, tribal knowledge, and organizational memory are strategic assets.

### Research Curation

Added transcripts to Research/ folder:
- AI Daily Brief podcast on context graphs
- NotebookLM deep dive on context graphs

These external sources validated and enriched the thinking on decision traces and the precedent layer.

## Open Items

### Strategic Questions Added

**Should CPF structure be prescriptive or emergent?**
- Four-tier model (Company/Department/Project/Individual) provides clear structure for document creation
- But context graphs suggest letting agents discover actual organizational patterns through use
- Does prescriptive structure risk constraining discovery of real "policy in practice"?
- Is there a hybrid: CPF provides intentional layer, agents reveal emergent layer?

**How do we design for agent-created context?**
- If agents build the Precedent Layer through work, what's the human role in initial setup?
- Do humans create first three layers (Knowledge, Ontological, Reasoning) and agents build fourth (Precedent)?
- Or do agents need decision traces from Day 1 to be effective?
- Can you bootstrap with humans documenting past decisions, then agents take over?
- What's the minimum viable context graph that makes agent-created traces useful?

**Context as competitive advantage—how do we message this?**
- Is this a feature or the core positioning?
- Does this shift value prop from "productivity tool" to "competitive infrastructure"?
- How do we help prospects understand their ICP clarity, decision traces, and tribal knowledge are strategic assets?

### Framework Development
- How do we validate the framework with organizations beyond our ICP?
- What patterns emerge from different company sizes/industries?
- Which layers provide the most immediate value?

### Business Model Evolution
- Does the service model lead naturally to productization, or are they parallel tracks?
- What's the right balance between done-for-you and self-serve?
- How does this complement vs. compete with existing AI training?
