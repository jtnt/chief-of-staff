## Current State

Context Profile Framework is in early exploration phase - developing the concept, writing content, and preparing for pilot validation. The framework documentation is solid; content creation is ongoing to build awareness and spark conversation.

## Recent Work

**Context Profile Benefits Article (WIP)**
- Drafted article explaining four key benefits of Context Profiles:
  1. Better AI results (more information = better output)
  2. Efficiency (load once, never repeat yourself)
  3. Consistency (same ICP definition in every interaction)
  4. Easier maintenance (update once, not dozens of prompts)
- Article saved to `Writing/20260114_context-profile-benefits/article.md`
- Copyedited and received stylistic feedback
- Two items remaining:
  - Complete the "Hello," sentence (currently truncated)
  - Expand the maintenance section (currently too short)

## Open Items

- **Article completion:** Finish the two WIP items above
- All existing open items from previous syncs remain active (atomic concepts, constitutional documents, node types, prescriptive vs. emergent structure, etc.)
