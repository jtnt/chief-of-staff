## Current State

Framework and service for creating AI context libraries. Four-layer architecture (Knowledge, Ontological, Reasoning, Precedent). Manual MVP phase - validating with pilots before building software. Google Drive delivery with Claude Projects sync.

## Recent Work

**This session:** Created LinkedIn post about Claude Cowork, tying it to Context Profile Framework

- Post argues that file system access is more powerful than "organize your files" demos suggest
- Key example: Cowork + Context Profile = always-on structured context access, plus AI can update context documents on the fly
- Documented owner's writing style preferences in CLAUDE.md (trust the reader, brevity, no dumbed-down explanations)
- Post saved to `Writing/20260112_cowork-hot-takes/post.md`

**Key insight:** Claude Cowork (and Claude Code before it) enables a new CPF access pattern - point AI directly at context files rather than manually loading into Claude Projects. This is a concrete use case for the framework beyond the theoretical.

## Open Items

- How to implement atomic concepts in CPF without over-complicating?
- Design constitutional documents for CPF service
- Define clearer node type criteria or simplify
- Should CPF structure be prescriptive or emergent?
- How do we design for agent-created context?
- Context as competitive advantage—positioning as feature vs. core message?
- Develop remaining research prompts
