# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Automation Maturity Assessment Works Well**: The approach of analyzing existing infrastructure first before recommending new automations was effective. Rather than suggesting basic features that already exist, the session identified sophisticated gaps like cross-project synthesis and background task notifications.

**Discovery-First Approach**: Starting with comprehensive exploration rather than assumptions led to more targeted recommendations. The user has an advanced automation stack that would make basic recommendations useless.

**Focus on Workflow Friction**: The most valuable recommendations addressed real workflow gaps (knowing when background tasks complete, synthesizing across projects) rather than theoretical improvements.
