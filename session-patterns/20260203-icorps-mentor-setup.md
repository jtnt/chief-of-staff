# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Persistent reminder requests require persistent artifacts** - When user says "remind me" or asks for future help, they need documented capture, not conversational promises. The user's correction about needing "something that will persist" reinforced this principle.

**Organizational structure emerges from real needs** - The Tasks folder wasn't pre-planned; it emerged naturally from having a legitimate standalone task that didn't fit existing project categories. This organic growth pattern works better than over-architecting upfront.

**Integration amplifies utility** - Adding Tasks to the morning briefing template immediately made the new folder more valuable. New systems need integration points with existing workflows to be effective.

## CLAUDE.md Suggestions

### For Project CLAUDE.md

```suggestion:project
## Persistent Capture Principle

When users request reminders or future help ("remind me", "help me tomorrow", "don't let me forget"), always create persistent artifacts. Never rely on conversational promises or assume they'll remember to ask again.

**Pattern:**
1. User asks for reminder → Create documented capture
2. Ask where to store it if unclear
3. Integrate with existing workflow systems when possible
```

### For Global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

```suggestion:global
## Organic Structure Development

Allow organizational structures to emerge from real use cases rather than pre-architecting. When users identify gaps ("this doesn't fit anywhere"), help them create appropriate containers, then document the new structure for future use.

**Examples:**
- Tasks folder emerged from standalone professional items
- Check-ins system grew from daily reflection needs
- Patterns from repeated workflow friction

Better to grow systems organically than over-engineer upfront.
