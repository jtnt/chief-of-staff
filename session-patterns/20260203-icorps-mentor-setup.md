# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Persistent reminder requests require persistent artifacts** - When user says "remind me" or asks for future help, they need documented capture, not conversational promises. The user's correction about needing "something that will persist" reinforced this principle.

**Organizational structure emerges from real needs** - The Tasks folder wasn't pre-planned; it emerged naturally from having a legitimate standalone task that didn't fit existing project categories. This organic growth pattern works better than over-architecting upfront.

**Integration amplifies utility** - Adding Tasks to the morning briefing template immediately made the new folder more valuable. New systems need integration points with existing workflows to be effective.
