# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Client research methodology worked well:** Starting with company research, then competitive landscape analysis, then connecting both to strategic positioning created comprehensive preparation. The AdvocacyAI deep-dive revealed framework gaps that became selling points rather than obstacles.

**Project folder organization emerged naturally:** When client work appeared, we needed to decide where it lives. Creating `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/` as shared resource makes sense - not nested under specific projects since clients may span multiple contexts.

**Morning check-in evolution:** User shared intentions upfront, which streamlined the briefing and made it more responsive. This avoided the generic calendar dump and created focused context pulling.

## Client Research Methodology

When preparing for business meetings with potential clients:

1. **Company research first:** Leadership team, business model, client base, recent news
2. **Competitive landscape analysis:** Understand tools/platforms they use or consider
3. **Strategic positioning:** Find gaps or complementary angles rather than competing directly
4. **Multiple scenario prep:** Prepare different pitches based on what you learn in the meeting
5. **Document everything:** Create client folder with prep notes for future reference

**Client folder location:** Use `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/[ClientName]/` for all client-related work, not nested under specific projects.
```

## Morning Check-In Optimization

**Intention-first model works better than calendar-first.** When user shares specific intentions or tasks upfront (like in /morning command args), use those to guide context pulling rather than dumping all available data.

**Example flow:**
1. User shares intentions: "Meeting with X, homework for Y, video idea about Z"
2. Pull calendar + context relevant to those specific items
3. Generate responsive briefing, not generic data dump
4. One priority alignment check against stated goals

This creates more focused, actionable morning briefings.
