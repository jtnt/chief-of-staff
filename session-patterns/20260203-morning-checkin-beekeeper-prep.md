# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Client research methodology worked well:** Starting with company research, then competitive landscape analysis, then connecting both to strategic positioning created comprehensive preparation. The AdvocacyAI deep-dive revealed framework gaps that became selling points rather than obstacles.

**Project folder organization emerged naturally:** When client work appeared, we needed to decide where it lives. Creating `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/` as shared resource makes sense - not nested under specific projects since clients may span multiple contexts.

**Morning check-in evolution:** User shared intentions upfront, which streamlined the briefing and made it more responsive. This avoided the generic calendar dump and created focused context pulling.
