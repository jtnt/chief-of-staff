# Session Patterns

## Observations

**Competitive research requires business model awareness:** When analyzing a competitor or similar organization for positioning insights, I initially copied their entire model instead of extracting what's actually transferable. Applied AI Society is a community-based open meetup; Razzo is a B2B service with a Sprint model. Many of their positioning elements (professional practice framing, three-persona structure, "Applied AI Engineer" identity) work *because* of their community model, not despite it.

**User correction revealed the extraction error:** User pointed out that I missed the core insight about "the bridge" — it's about shifting focus from tech to business, not creating a new identity. This triggered recognition that I was over-indexing on their specific tactics instead of extracting the underlying principle.

**Simplified analysis was more useful:** The revised analysis with just three insights (brand positioning, outcome framing, validation) was more actionable than the initial version with 8 positioning lessons and 4 content pillars.

## Competitive Research Analysis

When analyzing competitors, market comparables, or positioning examples for a project:

**Ask first:** What about their specific business model makes this work for them? Does our model share that characteristic?

**Extract principles, not tactics:**
- Good: "They position as 'no hype' which works because the market is saturated with AI hype. We should own similar anti-hype positioning."
- Bad: "They have three personas (engineers, business owners, tool builders). We should segment our messaging the same way."

**Business model differences matter:**
- Community-based vs B2B service
- Open vs closed/paid
- Individual practitioners vs enterprise teams
- Self-serve vs done-for-you

Don't copy positioning that works *because* of a different business model. Extract the underlying principle and apply it to the actual model.

**When the user corrects your analysis:** That's a signal you over-indexed on surface tactics instead of extractable principles. Simplify to just what's genuinely transferable.
