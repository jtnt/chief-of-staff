# Session Patterns: Inbox Prioritization and Briefing Focus

## Observations

**Meta-work accumulation problem:**
The CoS inbox kept accumulating system optimization tasks (inbox triage plugins, automation recommendations, skill naming fixes, SessionEnd delay investigation) that felt urgent but weren't. These showed up prominently in daily briefings and competed with actual project deliverables (Razzo, CPF, Writing, Job Search) for attention.

**User's clear statement of the problem:**
"All of these inbox items are sort of meta work and not high priority. We need to focus both the inbox and the morning briefing on real work."

**The solution that worked:**
Creating a three-tier inbox structure (Pending → Backlog → Archive) where:
- Pending = do now (project deliverables, revenue work)
- Backlog = revisit when there's time (system improvements)
- Archive = done or no longer relevant

**Why this worked:**
- Preserves the meta-work ideas (user wanted to keep them)
- Removes them from daily priority pressure
- The briefing can emphasize deliverables while still showing backlog count
- Clear language distinction: "Priority: N items" vs. "Backlog (meta-work): N items - when there's time"

**Pattern worth remembering:**
Meta-work optimization is seductive but rarely urgent. Real work = project deliverables and revenue-generating activities. The Chief of Staff's job is to nudge toward what matters, not validate system tinkering.
