## The Foundational Insight

People don't buy because of brand colors, logos, or style guides. They buy because they read words that make them want to buy.

**The Proof:** Amazon.com is an ugly website with an unimpressive logo - but it's text-heavy and people buy constantly.

**The Discovery:** The more you reduce the cognitive load of words, the more people buy.

> "If you make people think, they're not going to buy from you."

**The Problem Everyone Has:** Business owners and thought leaders want to sound smart and sophisticated. This is the exact opposite of what works. You need to sound as simple as possible - so simple that nobody has to think to figure it out.

> "It turns out that's a very hard thing to do."

## The Story Structure

Every story follows the same pattern:

1. A character is walking along at peace and stability
2. That character falls into a hole - their peace is destabilized
3. A guide comes along and says "I'm so sorry you're in that hole" and throws them a rope
4. The hero climbs out of the hole
5. They are restabilized to a sense of peace - only they've been transformed and are a better version of themselves

> "That is every movie you have ever seen."

Sometimes it's a group protagonist, sometimes a single protagonist, sometimes multiple guides throwing multiple ropes - but the structure is always the same.

---

## The Critical Reframe: You Are Not the Hero

> "Don't tell your story. Invite customers into a story."

Your customer is the hero of the story. You are the guide helping the hero win.

- Your customer is at peace
- They've fallen into a hole
- You own that hole
- Your product is the rope being thrown into the hole
- They climb out and experience transformation

---

## The Five Soundbites (PEACE)

You invite customers into a story using exactly five soundbites. That's it.

| Soundbite | Role in Story | What It Does |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **P**roblem | The hole they're in | You own a specific problem in your customer's mind |
| **E**mpathy | Guide positioning | "I care about you, I don't want you to struggle with this" |
| **A**nswer | The rope | Your product/service as the solution |
| **C**hange | Transformation | Who they become after climbing out |
| **E**nd Result | Happy ever after | The scene they get to experience |

**Why it spells PEACE:** You're returning your hero customer to peace.

**How to use them:** Take these five soundbites and populate ALL of your marketing - landing pages, websites, social media, lead generators, YouTube scripts. All of it needs to come back to these five soundbites being repeated over and over and over again.

> "A million times until you own that hole and anybody who falls in that hole calls you and gives you money."

## Own the Hole

**The Concept:** You need to own a specific problem in your customer's mind. Your product is the rope being thrown into that hole.

### Example: Aquarium Company

**Context:** A company dominates the aquarium market in pet stores (PetSmart, PetCo) - sells aquariums, charcoal, fish filters, everything but the fish. They had the hobbyist market but couldn't break into families.

**The Ask:** Help us break into the family market.

**Miller's Solution:** Three words - "Kids love aquariums"

Put it on the aquariums, on the fish food, on everything, on the signage.

**Their Reaction:** "Are you being serious right now? You think three words are really going to break us into a new market?"

**The Result:** 99% increase in sales in test market. In a $100 million market, that's $100 million to $199 million with no additional capital expenditure - just words.

**Why It Worked:** When a dad walks in with his kids thinking about getting a bunny or puppy or cat - but knows the thing is going to poop all over the house and he doesn't want to deal with it - he sees "Kids love aquariums." He doesn't have to think. The decision is made for him.

> "You didn't make them think."

---

## The One Problem Rule

**The Mistake:** Trying to explain 10 different things your product does.

> "A story cannot be about 10 different things. If Jason Bourne wants to know who he is AND lose 30 pounds AND marry the girl AND adopt a cat, we have lost the plot. You have dramatically increased the cognitive load of the movie-going audience and they won't like the movie - they just won't know why they don't like it. It's because you're making them think."

### Example: Oura Ring

**What Oura Ring Does:**
- Measures steps
- Measures heart rate
- Calculates HRV
- Helps optimize sleep
- Many other features (10+ things)

**What They Discovered:** When they stopped talking about all 10 things and picked ONE thing - sleep - and called it "a sleep lab on your finger," sales dramatically increased.

**The Model:** People buy the Oura Ring for sleep monitoring. After they buy it, they discover all the other things it does.

> "When they narrowed down and owned one problem rather than trying to own 10 problems, their sales dramatically increased."

**The Principle:**
- Lead with ONE problem
- Get them to the other side of the paywall first
- THEN blow them away with additional value

> "If you lead with all 10 things, you might as well lead with nothing."

---

## Specificity Over Vagueness

The problem you own cannot be vague. It must be very specific.

### Example: Dog Trainer

**Bad:** Selling "dog training"

**Good:** "Does your dog bark when somebody knocks at the door?"

Now you own that specific hole. How many people have that problem? Millions. You can build a $10 million certification business because you own that hole.

### Example: Real Estate Agent

**The Question:** "How would I differentiate myself?"

**Miller's Response:** "When you're at a cocktail party and somebody says what do you do, what do you say?"

**Their Answer:** "I tell them I'm a real estate agent."

**Miller:** "Okay, that's terrible. What else do you say - what's your differentiator?"

**Their Answer:** "I can help them find their dream home."

**Miller:** "Now we're getting somewhere."

**The New Introduction:**
> "87% of people live their entire life and never get to live in their dream home. I make sure they get to live in their dream home. I'm a real estate agent."

**The Transformation:** He's no longer just a real estate agent. He's a man on a mission. That mission is making sure you, as the hero, experience a climactic scene where you're living in your dream home.

> "That's called inviting a customer into a story in which I play the guide and they are the hero and they no longer have to live in a hole. And he did it with a soundbite."

## The YNAB Example (You Need A Budget)

**Context:** $50 million budgeting application in the app store.

**Their Pitch to Miller:** "It's really not about budgeting, it's about spending. We don't like the word budget - budget feels restrictive. We don't want to use that..."

**Miller's Assessment:** All these nuanced, sophisticated messaging ideas were going to cost way too many cognitive calories. Their cognitive load was ridiculously high.

**The Soundbite:** "Have you ever worried about money?"

**What This Does:** They now own the "worried about money" hole.

**The Reach:** What percentage of human beings have ever worried about money? 100%. They now own 100% of humanity as potential customers.

**The Formula:**
- "Anybody who worries about money buys my product"
- "Anybody who looks out a window and sees it's dirty buys my window washing solution"
- "Anybody who's having an argument in their marriage buys my therapy"

## Soundbites Beat Comprehensive Plans

> "I'm not a Republican or a Democrat... Jeb Bush wrote a book on immigration. Donald Trump had a soundbite. The soundbite beat the book."

"Build a wall" beat a comprehensive plan on immigration.

**Is that right?** No.
**Is that good?** No.
**Is that a fact?** Yes.

> "Nobody is sitting down pouring a glass of scotch giving you three hours to wonder whether they should buy your product. They are responding to a soundbite."

**The Consequence:** If you don't have that soundbite down, customers will go to your competition - who is inferior to you, who delivers less value for more money - and they will buy from them instead of you. Because they understand the offer.

---

## Repetition Is the Strategy

**The Discipline:** Coming up with the right soundbites requires ridiculous discipline in repeating those soundbites.

**Where to Repeat:**
- Every meeting
- Every keynote presentation
- Every video
- Text on the retail wall
- Every commercial
- On camera every time
- Back of your business card
- Lead generators
- Website

### The Geico Example

**The Soundbite:** "Save 15% on car insurance"

**The Investment:** $240 million in advertising spend every year

**The Strategy:** Repeat the same soundbite

**The Result:** Exponential growth

**The Background:** This was a Warren Buffett move. He bought the company, came up with the soundbites, increased advertising from about $11 million to $240 million specifically to get the public to memorize and repeat the offer. He makes billions because he did it.

> "You can do the same thing with a small company."

---

## Internal Alignment

If you have 100 employees and pull them all into an office one by one:

**When asked "What do you do?"** - They should all say the same thing.

**When asked "What problem do you solve?"** - They should all say the same thing.

**When asked "How do you transform a customer?"** - They should all say the same thing.

**When asked "What's the happy ever after your customer gets to experience?"** - They should all say the same thing.

**The Effect:** You convert your entire team - from the janitor to the CEO - into a sales force.

**The Method:** Repeat the same thing over and over until they begin to repeat it back to you.

> "Every good messaging campaign is an exercise in memorization."

## Training AI and Search Discovery

**How to Own a Hole in AI's Mind:**

1. Come up with the five soundbites
2. Disseminate them relentlessly
3. Every time you're on camera, say it
4. Put it everywhere
5. Hire a cheap company to release press releases (AI looks for press releases)

**What Happens:** AI starts picking up on the fact that you own that hole. You're training AI with repetition of the exact same soundbite.

**The Anti-Patterns:**
- If you own 10 holes, AI thinks of you 10 times less
- If you use different language, AI thinks of you 50 times less (because you said it 50 different ways)

**The Full Picture:** Do the same with all five soundbites (Problem, Empathy, Answer, Change, End Result). Now you own the entire story of that person getting out of that hole.

### Real Example

Miller's own business puts out certain facts and statements over and over. Now when he asks ChatGPT things, it comes back "like a boomerang" with the information they've been putting out.

---

## Copy vs. Design

> "If you go to an ad agency and pay them $100,000 to write you a really great email, and you come to me and I use my five soundbites - I'm probably going to beat them."

> "If you have a gorgeous, beautifully designed email and I have all text - I'm probably going to beat them."

**Why:** They're going to increase your cognitive load. Miller decreases cognitive load.

**The Exception:** Fashion and aspirational identity products - where you're selling an identity and have a really good-looking model. The visual IS the message.

> "Other than that, my copy is going to beat your images."

On the saying "A picture is worth a thousand words":

> "Not true. I can write a sentence that will beat your image."

---

## Email Structure

**Subject Line Best Practice:** "Struggling with X?" (question format)

Example: "Are you worried about finances right now?" - This will be a great subject line.

**Alternative Approaches:** "Five ways Taylor Swift is brilliant at managing her finances" - Works even though it's not a problem, because it's about Taylor Swift. There are nuances.

**Email Body Using the Five Soundbites:**

1. Open with the problem
2. Empathize with the problem ("I care about you, I don't want you to struggle with this")
3. Position your product as the solution to that problem
4. Describe how they're going to transform and be a better version of themselves
5. Paint the happy ever after - the end result their life is going to be

> "That email will outperform anything you've ever written, almost assuredly."

## Using AI for Copywriting

**Miller's View:** "I love AI. I absolutely adore AI."

**The Caveat:** "AI is a freshman in college who thinks a little too linear. I need to know what I'm looking for to know whether it's right."

### The Wrong Way

Ask: "I'm a real estate agent, how should I introduce myself?"

Result: AI won't give the right answer.

### The Right Way

**Step 1:** "I'm a real estate agent and I want to introduce myself. I want to start with the problem because it's such a great hook. Give me 10 different examples of problems I could own as a real estate agent."

**Step 2:** AI gives 10 examples. You choose one.

**Step 3:** "I really like this one. Can you boil this down to a soundbite?"

**Step 4:** "That soundbite is too nuanced. You got cute and clever with me. I need to decrease the cognitive load on my customer."

**The Pattern:** You're coaching AI with a framework in mind, with an end result in mind. Then you as a human have the ability to say "that's it, that's the one."

> "If you just go and ask it for an answer, it's going to give you the wrong answer."

### AI Focus Groups

**The Technique:** Take 4-5 taglines (or even a full book draft) and prompt:

"Pretend you're a book club with five different members:
- A left-leaning feminist liberal
- A right-leaning conservative male
- A school teacher
- A fan of Donald Miller
- Somebody who's never heard of me

They've just read this. Give me their soundbites and tell me specifically what they won't like about this."

**Then Iterate:**
- "The feminist perspective is important to me. How can I mitigate the damage to soften this for that perspective?"
- "Show me lines I can put in that would mitigate the cognitive load for them."
- Drop lines back in, ask for the same analysis again
- Keep iterating for better results

**The Key:** AI is a fantastic focus group. You can create focus groups with 10 different personalities. But AI isn't human, so you still need to test with real humans to see where AI was off.
