## Summary

**"Creating the Perfect CLAUDE.md for Claude Code"** by Ivan Kahl (Jan 15, 2026)

Guide on structuring CLAUDE.md files effectively. Key sections recommended:
- Terminal commands (specific flags, syntax your team uses)
- Workflows (step-by-step processes for common tasks)
- Coding standards (naming, indentation, comments)
- Domain terminology (business jargon definitions)
- Architecture details (project structure, design patterns)
- MCP instructions (when to use configured tools)

Emphasizes keeping it concise (context window), treating it as living document, and version-controlling it.

## Why Saved

Relevant to Chief of Staff system design and ongoing CLAUDE.md refinement across projects.
