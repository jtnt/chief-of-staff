# Astro: Content-First Web Framework

**Author:** Astro team | **Published:** N/A (product homepage)

## Summary

Astro is a JavaScript web framework optimized for building fast, content-driven websites like marketing sites, blogs, and e-commerce platforms. It uses a server-first architecture with "islands" of interactivity, delivering lightweight HTML while minimizing JavaScript sent to browsers.

## Key Points

- **Server-first rendering** - Components render on server, sending minimal JS to browser
- **Islands architecture** - Only interactive components hydrate, rest stays static HTML
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact
- **Performance leader** - 62% of Astro sites achieve good Core Web Vitals (vs 29% for Next.js, 46% for WordPress)
- **Content flexibility** - Pull from file system, APIs, or any CMS
- **Built-in features** - Content collections, view transitions, image optimization, file-based routing

## Why Saved

Potential option for content-heavy sites (Razzo marketing site, blog). Performance focus aligns with modern web standards. Worth evaluating for future projects.
