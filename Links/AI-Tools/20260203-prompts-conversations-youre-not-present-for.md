# Prompts Are Conversations You're Not Present For

**Author:** Limited Edition Jonathan | **Published:** January 24, 2026

## Summary

Rather than using AI for direct personal conversations, design prompts that other people run independently. By packaging structured thinking processes into prompts, teams can conduct parallel problem-solving at their own pace, then compare outputs—as demonstrated when establishing an operating agreement with a business partner in days rather than weeks.

## Key Points

- **Absence-driven design**: You're not writing instructions for AI, but designing a conversation someone else will have without you present
- **Three principles**: Minimize cognitive load (sequential questions, not upfront synthesis), Q&A context extraction (help people discover what they think), output usable artifacts (not explanations)
- **Partnership agreement case study**: Jonathan and co-founder Nate used a structured prompt to independently articulate positions on capital, tie-breakers, valuations, and vesting—then compared outputs to finalize agreement in days instead of weeks
- **Sequential questioning**: Front-load discovery with specific, answerable questions rather than asking for complex synthesis upfront
- **Structured output**: Prompts should produce directly comparable, actionable deliverables (documents, templates, tables) not explanations requiring further translation

## Why Saved

Foundational concept for the `/envoy` skill—designing conversations as thinking proxies. Direct application to how to structure input-gathering, partnership decisions, feedback collection, and stakeholder discovery.
