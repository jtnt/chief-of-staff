# Using Claude Code with Obsidian - A Perfect Pairing for Knowledge Work

**Author:** Kyle Gao | **Published:** November 22, 2025

## Summary

Kyle Gao explores how Claude Code can automate tedious knowledge management tasks in Obsidian, transforming aspirational note-taking practices from obligations into engaging workflows. The pairing works because Obsidian vaults function like codebases with markdown files that Claude can navigate and edit, and AI's strengths (automation, consistency) align perfectly with human friction points (motivation, time).

## Key Points

- **Structural similarity** - Obsidian vaults are filesystems of markdown files, just like codebases Claude can navigate
- **Capability match** - AI automation excels where human energy flags (backlinking, formatting, applying frameworks)
- **Automated backlinking** - Claude identifies entities and adds wiki-links throughout documents
- **Formatting and organization** - Converts unstructured thoughts into structured reviews
- **Investment retrospectives** - Systematically compares theses against actual outcomes
- **Mental model application** - Evaluates decisions using established frameworks consistently

## Why Saved

Direct relevance to Chief of Staff system design. Obsidian+Claude Code pattern could enhance knowledge capture and synthesis across projects. Explores removing friction from metadata management tasks.
