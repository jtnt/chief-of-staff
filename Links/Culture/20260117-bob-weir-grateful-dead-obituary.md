# Bob Weir's One Last Saturday Night

**Author:** Steven Hyden | **Published:** January 12, 2026

## Summary

An obituary celebrating Bob Weir, co-founder of the Grateful Dead, who passed away at 78 from cancer complications. Hyden reflects on Weir's extraordinary six-decade career from 1965-2025, his unconventional guitar style, and his role as "the spirit" of the band after Jerry Garcia's death.

## Key Points

- Co-founded the Warlocks (later Grateful Dead) at 16 with Jerry Garcia
- Unconventional guitar style inspired by jazz pianist McCoy Tyner
- Championed country music integration into the Dead's repertoire
- Kept the Dead alive post-Garcia through various iterations including Dead & Company
- Embodied "greatness intertwined with goofiness" - spiritual depth balanced with theatrical silliness
- Philosophy encapsulated in "One More Saturday Night": celebration and community, "the party always takes precedence"

## Why Saved

Personal interest - Grateful Dead fan.
