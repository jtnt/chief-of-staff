# Weekly Reviews

Manual review documents created by `/review-checkins` command.

## How It Works

Run `/review-checkins` anytime to analyze check-ins and logs:
1. Specify time period (default: last 7 days)
2. Optionally include session logs from all tracked projects
3. Get analysis of patterns, themes, and insights
4. Optionally save the review here

## When to Use

- End of week reflection (not just Monday mornings)
- When you want deeper analysis than the automated Monday synthesis
- When you want to include project session logs (not just check-ins)
- When extracting cross-project patterns to save to `Patterns/`

## File Format

```markdown
# Check-In Review - [Date Range]

## Projects & Focus
[Which projects got attention]

## Completion Patterns
[What gets done vs. what carries over]

## Energy Trends
[Patterns in mood/energy across days]

## Ideas to Develop
[From thoughts and check-ins]

## Cross-Project Patterns (if logs included)
[Insights that apply across projects]
