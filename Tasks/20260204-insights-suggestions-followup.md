# Insights Report — Remaining Suggestions to Revisit

From the Claude Code Insights report (2026-02-04). These are workflow automation ideas to explore when ready.

## Custom Skills
Bundle the daily planning kickoff (git status, TODO review, pattern check, priorities) into a reusable `/daily` skill so you don't re-explain the routine each morning.

## Hooks
Auto-verify broken path references after file edits. Could catch reorganization bugs before they get committed.

## Headless Mode
Script recurring tasks (daily summaries, broken reference scans) to run without opening an interactive session. Could pair well with the daily planning skill.

## TodoWrite for Reorganizations
Before starting multi-step file moves, create a checklist: files to move, references to update, verification steps. Creates an audit trail and prevents missed steps.

## Consolidate Daily Planning
Combine git status review, pattern review, and daily planning into a single structured kickoff prompt instead of running them as separate conversations.
