# Fix inbox-triage label naming

Labels prefixed with "Newsletters/" are unreadable in Gmail's sidebar. Drop the prefix — just use the sender name as the label (e.g., "The Information" not "Newsletters/The Information").

Consider: should there be a parent label at all? Or just flat labels per sender? Check how Gmail displays nested vs flat labels in sidebar and label chips on emails.
