❯ Implement the following plan:                                             
                                                                            
  # Meeting Review v6 Fixes                                                 
                                                                            
  ## Summary                                                                
  Fix file-to-meeting association workflow, and resolve persistent          
  permission prompts.                                                       
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Issue 1: File-to-Meeting Association                                   
                                                                            
  **Problem**: When processing multiple meetings, Step 5 asks for           
  additional materials for ALL meetings at once. When user drags multiple   
  files, Claude doesn't know which file goes with which meeting and has to  
  ask, often guessing incorrectly.                                          
                                                                            
  **Current flow (problematic)**:                                           
  ```                                                                       
  Step 4: Show all meetings                                                 
  Step 5: "Do you have any additional materials for these meetings?" → User 
  drags 2 files                                                             
  Step 6: Claude guesses both files are for meeting 1 (wrong)               
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  **Root cause**: Step 5 asks about materials globally before knowing which 
  meetings will be processed. Files have no context about which meeting     
  they belong to.                                                           
                                                                            
  **Fix in `~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md`**:                        
                                                                            
  **Remove Step 5** as a separate step. Instead, ask about additional       
  materials **per-meeting** during Step 8 processing:                       
                                                                            
  ```markdown                                                               
  ### Step 8: Process Each Meeting (One at a Time)                          
                                                                            
  For EACH selected meeting:                                                
                                                                            
  #### 8a: Ask for additional materials (per meeting)                       
  ```                                                                       
  Processing: "[Meeting Name]" (Jan 15)                                     
                                                                            
  Do you have any additional materials for THIS meeting?                    
  - External transcript                                                     
  - Notes or documents                                                      
  - Images, slides, or files                                                
                                                                            
  Provide file paths/drag files, or say "no" to continue.                   
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  Wait for response before proceeding with this meeting.                    
                                                                            
  #### 8b: Create folder and save materials                                 
  [... rest of processing ...]                                              
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  **Benefits**:                                                             
  - Clear which meeting files belong to                                     
  - No guessing or follow-up questions                                      
  - User can skip meetings without materials quickly ("no")                 
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Issue 2: Permissions & Future Automation                               
                                                                            
  **Current problem**: Claude Code prompts for permissions even when        
  patterns exist in settings.json.                                          
                                                                            
  **Future goal**: Autonomous operation - run without user input when       
  Granola adds transcripts.                                                 
                                                                            
  **Two-phase approach:**                                                   
                                                                            
  ### Phase A: Fix for interactive use (v6)                                 
                                                                            
  For now, keep `/meeting-review` as an interactive command. Accept that    
  some prompts may appear on first run (user can "allow for session").      
                                                                            
  Remove the permissions we added in v5 that aren't working reliably:       
  - `Read(/tmp/*)`, `Read(/tmp/**)`                                         
  - `Write(**/cos-inbox.md)`                                                
  - `Bash(cat /tmp/*:*)`                                                    
                                                                            
  These were attempting to pre-approve operations that Claude Code doesn't  
  match correctly.                                                          
                                                                            
  ### Phase B: Autonomous agent (future, separate effort)                   
                                                                            
  Build a standalone Python script for autonomous operation:                
                                                                            
  ```                                                                       
  ~/.claude/scripts/meeting-review-agent.py                                 
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  **Architecture:**                                                         
  1. **Trigger**: launchd job or file watcher on Granola cache              
  2. **Detection**: Compare cache against processed-meetings.json           
  3. **Processing**:                                                        
  - Auto-detect project from attendees/calendar                             
  - Auto-classify meeting type (webinar vs meeting)                         
  - Call Anthropic API for summary generation                               
  4. **Output**: Write files directly (no Claude Code permission layer)     
  5. **Notification**: Optional notification when complete                  
                                                                            
  **Why separate script:**                                                  
  - No interactive prompts needed                                           
  - No permission system (direct file access)                               
  - Can run headless/background                                             
  - Simpler, more reliable for automation                                   
                                                                            
  **Defer to separate planning session** - this is a significant new        
  component.                                                                
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Files to Modify                                                        
                                                                            
  | File | Changes |                                                        
  |------|---------|                                                        
  | `~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md` | Remove Step 5; add per-meeting 
  materials prompt in Step 8a |                                             
  | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Remove unreliable v5 permissions (optional  
  cleanup) |                                                                
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Verification                                                           
                                                                            
  1. **File association**: Process 2 meetings, provide different files for  
  each - files should be correctly associated without confusion             
  2. **Permissions**: Accept prompts on first run, or use "allow for        
  session" option                                                           
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Future Work (separate effort)                                          
                                                                            
  - Design autonomous meeting-review-agent.py

⏺ I'll implement the Meeting Review v6 fixes. Let me start by reading the
  current files.

⏺ Read(~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md)
  ⎿  Read 591 lines

⏺ Read(~/.claude/settings.json)
  ⎿  Read 249 lines

⏺ Now I understand the current state. Let me implement both changes.

  Issue 1: Remove Step 5 (global materials question) and add per-meeting
  materials prompt in Step 8.

  Issue 2: Remove unreliable v5 permissions from settings.json.

⏺ Both changes are complete. Here's a summary:

  Changes Made

  1. File-to-Meeting Association (~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md)

  Removed global Step 5 (asked about materials for ALL meetings at once)

  Added per-meeting materials prompt as Step 7a:
  Processing: "[Meeting Name]" (Jan 15)

  Do you have any additional materials for THIS meeting?
  - External transcript
  - Notes or documents
  - Images, slides, or files

  Provide file paths/drag files, or say "no" to continue.

  Updated step numbering:
  - Step 5 → BATCH Meeting Types
  - Step 6 → BATCH Project Routing
  - Step 7 → Process Each Meeting (7a-7g substeps)
  - Step 8 → Update Tracking
  - Step 9 → Show Completion Summary

  2. Permissions Cleanup (~/.claude/settings.json)

  Removed unreliable v5 permissions:
  - Read(/tmp/*)
  - Read(/tmp/**)
  - Write(**/cos-inbox.md)
  - Bash(cat /tmp/*:*)

  ---
  Verification: When you next run /meeting-review with 2+ meetings, dragging a
  file will clearly associate with whichever meeting is currently being
  processed (the one shown in the "Processing:" prompt).

  ## Issue 1: File-to-Meeting Association                                   
                                                                            
  **Problem**: When processing multiple meetings, Step 5 asks for           
  additional materials for ALL meetings at once. When user drags multiple   
  files, Claude doesn't know which file goes with which meeting and has to  
  ask, often guessing incorrectly.                                          
                                                                            
  **Current flow (problematic)**:                                           
  ```                                                                       
  Step 4: Show all meetings                                                 
  Step 5: "Do you have any additional materials for these meetings?" → User 
  drags 2 files                                                             
  Step 6: Claude guesses both files are for meeting 1 (wrong)               
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  **Root cause**: Step 5 asks about materials globally before knowing which 
  meetings will be processed. Files have no context about which meeting     
  they belong to.                                                           
                                                                            
  **Fix in `~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md`**:                        
                                                                            
  **Remove Step 5** as a separate step. Instead, ask about additional       
  materials **per-meeting** during Step 8 processing:                       
                                                                            
  ```markdown                                                               
  ### Step 8: Process Each Meeting (One at a Time)                          
                                                                            
  For EACH selected meeting:

  Do you have any additional materials for THIS meeting?                    
  - External transcript

  Provide file paths/drag files, or say "no" to continue.                   
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  Wait for response before proceeding with this meeting.

  - Clear which meeting files belong to                                     
  - No guessing or follow-up questions                                      
  - User can skip meetings without materials quickly ("no")                 
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Issue 2: Permissions & Future Automation                               
                                                                            
  **Current problem**: Claude Code prompts for permissions even when        
  patterns exist in settings.json.                                          
                                                                            
  **Future goal**: Autonomous operation - run without user input when       
  Granola adds transcripts.                                                 
                                                                            
  **Two-phase approach:**                                                   
                                                                            
  ### Phase A: Fix for interactive use (v6)                                 
                                                                            
  For now, keep `/meeting-review` as an interactive command. Accept that    
  some prompts may appear on first run (user can "allow for session").      
                                                                            
  Remove the permissions we added in v5 that aren't working reliably:       
  - `Read(/tmp/*)`, `Read(/tmp/**)`                                         
  - `Write(**/cos-inbox.md)`                                                
  - `Bash(cat /tmp/*:*)`                                                    
                                                                            
  These were attempting to pre-approve operations that Claude Code doesn't  
  match correctly.                                                          
                                                                            
  ### Phase B: Autonomous agent (future, separate effort)                   
                                                                            
  Build a standalone Python script for autonomous operation:                
                                                                            
  ```                                                                       
  ~/.claude/scripts/meeting-review-agent.py                                 
  ```                                                                       
                                                                            
  **Architecture:**                                                         
  1. **Trigger**: launchd job or file watcher on Granola cache              
  2. **Detection**: Compare cache against processed-meetings.json           
  3. **Processing**:                                                        
  - Auto-detect project from attendees/calendar                             
  - Auto-classify meeting type (webinar vs meeting)                         
  - Call Anthropic API for summary generation                               
  4. **Output**: Write files directly (no Claude Code permission layer)     
  5. **Notification**: Optional notification when complete                  
                                                                            
  **Why separate script:**                                                  
  - No interactive prompts needed                                           
  - No permission system (direct file access)                               
  - Can run headless/background                                             
  - Simpler, more reliable for automation                                   
                                                                            
  **Defer to separate planning session** - this is a significant new        
  component.                                                                
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Files to Modify                                                        
                                                                            
  | File | Changes |                                                        
  |------|---------|                                                        
  | `~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md` | Remove Step 5; add per-meeting 
  materials prompt in Step 8a |                                             
  | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Remove unreliable v5 permissions (optional  
  cleanup) |                                                                
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Verification                                                           
                                                                            
  1. **File association**: Process 2 meetings, provide different files for  
  each - files should be correctly associated without confusion             
  2. **Permissions**: Accept prompts on first run, or use "allow for        
  session" option                                                           
                                                                            
  ---

⏺ I'll implement the Meeting Review v6 fixes. Let me start by reading the
  current files.

⏺ Read(~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md)
  ⎿  Read 591 lines

⏺ Read(~/.claude/settings.json)
  ⎿  Read 249 lines

⏺ Now I understand the current state. Let me implement both changes.

  Issue 1: Remove Step 5 (global materials question) and add per-meeting
  materials prompt in Step 8.

  Issue 2: Remove unreliable v5 permissions from settings.json.

⏺ Both changes are complete. Here's a summary:

  Changes Made

  1. File-to-Meeting Association (~/.claude/commands/meeting-review.md)

  Removed global Step 5 (asked about materials for ALL meetings at once)

  Added per-meeting materials prompt as Step 7a:
  Processing: "[Meeting Name]" (Jan 15)

  Do you have any additional materials for THIS meeting?
  - External transcript
  - Notes or documents
  - Images, slides, or files

  Provide file paths/drag files, or say "no" to continue.

  Updated step numbering:
  - Step 5 → BATCH Meeting Types
  - Step 6 → BATCH Project Routing
  - Step 7 → Process Each Meeting (7a-7g substeps)
  - Step 8 → Update Tracking
  - Step 9 → Show Completion Summary

  2. Permissions Cleanup (~/.claude/settings.json)

  Removed unreliable v5 permissions:
  - Read(/tmp/*)
  - Read(/tmp/**)
  - Write(**/cos-inbox.md)
  - Bash(cat /tmp/*:*)

  Verification: When you next run /meeting-review with 2+ meetings, dragging a
  file will clearly associate with whichever meeting is currently being
  processed (the one shown in the "Processing:" prompt).
