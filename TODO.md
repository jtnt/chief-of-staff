# Chief of Staff TODO

## Revisit ContextOS Integration Plan

**Added:** 2026-01-10 11:21 PM EST
**Plan file:** `~/.claude/plans/spicy-popping-puzzle.md`

Explored ContextOS system and designed integration to bring its best features to CoS:
- Attribution system (VERIFIED/INFERRED tags)
- Automatic decision capture
- Pattern validation lifecycle (Hypothesis → Validated → Canonical)
- Light ontological layer

**Next step:** Review plan with fresh eyes, decide on implementation approach.

## Consider Global Rollout of session-context.md

Currently testing proactive knowledge capture via `session-context.md` in Chief of Staff only. If it proves valuable, consider rolling out to other projects.

*Note: Previous TODO items about `/update-knowledge`, `/update-cos`, and `/save-progress` commands were removed 2026-01-17 after those commands were replaced by the simpler `/log` and `/save` system.*
