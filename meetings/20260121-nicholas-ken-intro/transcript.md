2026-01-21T21:30:58.951Z
What's up, dude?

2026-01-21T21:31:01.671Z
How you doing?

2026-01-21T21:31:04.551Z
I'm chilling.

2026-01-21T21:31:05.991Z
My wife had surgery on Sunday, and it's about a two week recovery kind of thing without too much detail. So my brain's a little scattered, a little dysregulated, but very happy that everything was okay, if that makes sense.

2026-01-21T21:31:18.631Z
100%.

2026-01-21T21:31:19.751Z
Yeah, My wife actually, coincidentally had surgery now going on seven weeks ago, so I know where you're at.

2026-01-21T21:31:20.151Z
Yeah. Anyway.

2026-01-21T21:31:29.191Z
You doing okay?

2026-01-21T21:31:30.471Z
Yeah, all good. It was elective. Something that she needed to get done, so not an emergency, so at least that.

2026-01-21T21:31:38.711Z
But still long recovery.

2026-01-21T21:31:42.391Z
And while we're in this space, shout out to the husbands doing the work of supporting their wives through everything, too. Right? It's like, we hear a lot about the emotional labor that women unfortunately, have to go through often, but, you know, shout out to the real ones as well.

2026-01-21T21:31:55.671Z
On our side.

2026-01-21T21:31:57.271Z
Well, my wife's issue was with her foot, and so it meant that she essentially was bedridden for over a week.

2026-01-21T21:32:07.831Z
We got home, brought her upstairs and she didn't leave the. That floor, really didn't leave bed for, like I said, about a week until she had her follow up. And so it was every meal, it was every week. Exactly. I even had to, like, help her to the bathroom and stuff like that. So it was. Intense. We don't have kids. I don't have au. We don't have kids. And it gave me a small look at what it was like, what it would be like to have kids, because she completely relied on me, right?

2026-01-21T21:32:19.831Z
Oh, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:32:20.791Z
Yeah, back rubs.

2026-01-21T21:32:27.511Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:32:38.711Z
Yep. Do you all have pets?

2026-01-21T21:32:39.031Z
So it was interesting.

2026-01-21T21:32:41.431Z
Like a dog or Kettering.

2026-01-21T21:32:42.631Z
We have one cat named Emma. Yes, and I have a million pictures of her on my phone.

2026-01-21T21:32:49.431Z
Bro. I. I don't care what anybody says. I love to see a picture of somebody's animals. I. I'm obsessed with dogs and cats. I think it's awesome. I don't care. I want to see them all.

2026-01-21T21:33:01.031Z
I'm the same. I'll send you one or two after this. We'll trade cell phone number so we can text each other.

2026-01-21T21:33:08.471Z
Yeah. I mean, I've got a. He's part. His name's simba.

2026-01-21T21:33:11.431Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:33:12.231Z
He's part Australian shepherd, border collie and blue healer. So, I mean, like, every bit of the herding breed stuff that you would expect. And too smart for his own good and adorable.

2026-01-21T21:33:22.951Z
I was going to say probably gorgeous.

2026-01-21T21:33:24.711Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:33:25.591Z
Absolutely breathtaking to see, like, people, like, stop, especially when we're running through the. We. We grew up in Portland, Oregon, and so we're up in the woods a lot. And some of these will be, like, at night or in the morning, and Simraol just comes sprinting around the corner, and people will like, jump back. Like, what is that creature?

2026-01-21T21:33:42.311Z
Right? Right. I don't even know. I'd have to. What was the third breed that you said?

2026-01-21T21:33:48.071Z
The blue healer.

2026-01-21T21:33:49.911Z
Yeah, yeah, that one. I've never even heard of that. I mean, I'm not. I'm not. I don't know a lot about dog breeds. Dog breeds and tree identification. Just thing that I like, my brain can't do for some reason, but I never even heard of that.

2026-01-21T21:34:03.031Z
Yeah. If you check it out, they're basic. So they weren't actually, like, from Australia, but their cattle dogs. I mean, their. Their whole job is to, like, take damage to the face from hosts and just work tirelessly for 14 hours. Like, sometimes Simba will get injured and we won't know because they're. Just so stoic. You know what I mean? They don't say anything. They just work.

2026-01-21T21:34:07.991Z
Australia.

2026-01-21T21:34:22.471Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:34:23.911Z
I'm looking now. They. They look rough. They look like. They look solid.

2026-01-21T21:34:29.751Z
They're dense, dude.

2026-01-21T21:34:33.191Z
He's mostly Australian shepherd. Like, if you picture how he looks.

2026-01-21T21:34:36.071Z
I mean, he's all over my LinkedIn. But he's got the looks of the Australian Shepherd. So kind of fluffy and aloof, but his brain is pure border collie and healer. Like, that dude will just run like you do the Ultras. He could run right beside you and, like, not pass out.

2026-01-21T21:34:38.391Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:34:50.311Z
Sure.

2026-01-21T21:34:51.511Z
I would love that. My wife wants. I mean, she loves. We love. We both love cats. This is our second cat. We just got Emma after our first cat died, like, a handful of months ago.

2026-01-21T21:35:03.191Z
But she is still very much like, I want a dog. I want something that I can, like, go places with, like, take. And I'm like, I'm fine with a dog.

2026-01-21T21:35:12.311Z
As long as we get one that I can go running with. Or we'll go running with me.

2026-01-21T21:35:16.151Z
Absolutely.

2026-01-21T21:35:16.871Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:35:17.511Z
Yeah, now, that'd be great.

2026-01-21T21:35:18.231Z
Yeah, that's something. I don't think people like my friends, Ken. I've told this to their faces. I love them, but they, like, didn't consider their own temperaments.

2026-01-21T21:35:27.751Z
And, like, lifestyle happen to match to the dogs. So some of them have, like, a pit bull, husky, Malinois mix, and they're just, like, home bodies who sit on the. And, like, that's fine, but get a different thing or, like, you know what I mean? Like, I'm like, I need something that. Can run without getting tired, who I can do tricks with, who can, like, perfect heal when we're out in public, you know what I mean? Like, that's. I want to do the work and I want to have that. So kudos to you guys, but just choose wisely.

2026-01-21T21:35:42.631Z
I get a lot of dogs.

2026-01-21T21:35:54.391Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:35:54.951Z
Well, that's the other thing. I was brought up in a house. I grew up in rural Virginia, like, rural central Virginia. And we. My parents were really big on dog obedience.

2026-01-21T21:35:59.751Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:36:06.951Z
And so they were always under voice control. And it was like it wasn't even voice control. It was hand signals, right?

2026-01-21T21:36:07.591Z
Yep.

2026-01-21T21:36:10.151Z
Yep.

2026-01-21T21:36:12.151Z
Sign language? Yep. Seminars.

2026-01-21T21:36:13.671Z
Yep.

2026-01-21T21:36:14.071Z
Like, you put your hand up, we lie down, and, like, my friends are like, what is going on? You know, like, this dog is reading your mind. You could. You could really do some fun things. And so I know that if I ever got a dog, I would have to do the whole obedience school thing, because it's. A pet peeve of mine. I can't. Especially as a runner. And I run. I live. So there's a big park in D.C. called Rock Creek Park. It's two and a half times the size of Central Park. And. And it's. And it's a wild park. It's not like. Central park, where there's baseball fields and all this stuff, so there's just trails everywhere.

2026-01-21T21:36:18.471Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:36:47.751Z
I can't tell you how many times. And of course, there's signs everywhere that said, like, leash your dogs. And my wife has actually been attacked by a dog in the past, and so I'm really just, like, on her behalf, sensitive to unleashed dogs, and I just can't. I just. I hate and. It's not the dog. I know, but, like, so, like, how to phrase it? But, like, I hate people who have not trained their dog, right? Like, I don't hate dog. I hate the people that have not trained their dog to be under their control.

2026-01-21T21:37:11.431Z
Oh, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:37:16.391Z
I'm with you, man. I.

2026-01-21T21:37:18.871Z
It's funny. When we. We lived in New York for a while, so. Yeah, Prospect park was right across the street. We would go running really early in the morning every day. But I also grew up. Oh, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:37:27.511Z
I live near Prosper Park. Where did you live?

2026-01-21T21:37:30.231Z
Oh. So Prok South. And then we were near. I forget the entrance, but it's like the big gate on the. On the south side. And then there's like a little bridge that you go across. I don't know if that means anything to you, but.

2026-01-21T21:37:43.431Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:37:44.231Z
If you just look up Prospect Park South Apartments like,

2026-01-21T21:37:46.391Z
Gran Army Plaza, like the big, big one.

2026-01-21T21:37:50.791Z
Like the main entrance.

2026-01-21T21:37:53.591Z
Let me double check.

2026-01-21T21:37:54.631Z
Because that was three years ago.

2026-01-21T21:37:58.071Z
Dude, I lived there in the 90s, so.

2026-01-21T21:38:01.271Z
Yeah, like yes. Yes, exactly. So I ran past this dude. It's so crazy. Yeah, I ran past this almost. Not every day, but most days. That's how we stay sane.

2026-01-21T21:38:09.991Z
Yeah, yeah. There's a little farmers market there.

2026-01-21T21:38:12.711Z
Yep. And then we grew up in Portland, Oregon, and that's where Simba, you know, when we got him. And so there's a giant park out there, too, so I think that's great. And one time, Simba got, like, basically attacked by a bunch of dogs.

2026-01-21T21:38:27.271Z
And I have no problem. Like, I was, like, literally throwing, like, throwing hands at those dogs and, like, shouting at their owners. I really do believe you shouldn't be at a park if you haven't done, like, obedience.

2026-01-21T21:38:34.231Z
We.

2026-01-21T21:38:38.151Z
100%. 100%.

2026-01-21T21:38:39.991Z
And as they say, it's, there are no bad dogs or just bad dog owners. So I, I, I'm down with that. But like, you, like, because I sort of prepare myself, I very rarely had to use this, but I definitely believe in this, like, the, the notion of.

2026-01-21T21:38:57.591Z
You have to prepare yourself for what's coming next. So they say that like when you're on a plane, right? Listen to the safety instructions, right? And actually do look where the exit rows are, because if you are in an emergency situation, that will help you.

2026-01-21T21:39:13.911Z
Right? And I'm. And you know, just that, like, mental preparation.

2026-01-21T21:39:17.991Z
I think it goes along sort of with that whole notion of, like, if I. What do they call it? Priming, where, like, if a doctor says this is going to hurt, even though, like. And if a doctor doesn't say it's going to hurt, they do the same thing and, like, whether they said it's going to hurt or not. You know, it makes it worse. I think it's attached to that. And so, like, I'm always like. When I go into the park, I'm like, all right, you know, if I. If this happens to me or if a dog. I see a person with a dog coming up. I'm like, if goes down, what am I going to do? And it's like, yeah, I'm. I'm going to attack your dog. If you're a dog, it talks to me, attack me. I'm going after your dog. Like, I'm punching your dog. I'm doing whatever I. Have to grab a nearby rocks. Whatever I have to do, like. Sorry, but yeah.

2026-01-21T21:39:51.751Z
100.

2026-01-21T21:40:00.471Z
Yeah, it works, like. So I've done, like, martial arts and, like, wrestling and stuff, and it's funny.

2026-01-21T21:40:04.391Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:40:05.351Z
You can actually do something.

2026-01-21T21:40:07.271Z
Yeah, you. You hope that you'll never be in these situations, but, like, it's very calming to, like, at least somewhat have some built in, like, habitual reactions that are muscle memory. And the same thing with training, Simba, like, people train at home.

2026-01-21T21:40:21.991Z
You start training at home and then you stress test out in the field. So, like, Simba goes a quarter of a mile away in a pack full of dogs and I do like, one or two whistles.

2026-01-21T21:40:33.191Z
That's how I know the recall works. Not when he's, like, in the backyard with a couple of treats in my hand, just. You know what I mean?

2026-01-21T21:40:38.391Z
Total. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got to do it under real world pressure situations.

2026-01-21T21:40:43.751Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:40:44.551Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:40:45.191Z
Yeah, but anyway, enough about pets, man. Yeah. So tell me about these ultras.

2026-01-21T21:40:48.471Z
Y.

2026-01-21T21:40:50.871Z
Eah.

2026-01-21T21:40:51.511Z
I always wanted to do either a Olympic distance or a full triathlon by the time I was 35. So I only had two more years. But like, I've done a handful of marathons but never 50 mile run. That's crazy.

2026-01-21T21:41:03.751Z
Yes, it is. I'll admit that. I mean, I always say that, like, everyone can do these things that I do. Also. I understand that everyone might not want to do these things that I do, but I truly believe everyone can do these things, and they can do a lot more than they. They think so.

2026-01-21T21:41:21.271Z
The Ultras are relatively new, so my first One was in 2022.

2026-01-21T21:41:26.311Z
I think that's right.

2026-01-21T21:41:28.791Z
And it was sort of a mistake. So I've been running seriously since, like, 2011 or so. I started getting into. I started doing tough mudders. You know, those.

2026-01-21T21:41:36.871Z
Oh, wow.

2026-01-21T21:41:40.071Z
Love those.

2026-01-21T21:41:41.271Z
Okay, So I did those for a few years. Stopped because the risk of injury I felt was too great.

2026-01-21T21:41:49.271Z
Did you do the electricity? Did they have the electricity for you?

2026-01-21T21:41:51.031Z
All that.

2026-01-21T21:41:52.631Z
I couldn't. It knocked us out, like, actually blacked out on the ground. I woke back up, kept running. I was like, is this what I signed up? Anyway, I loved it, but, like, sketchy.

2026-01-21T21:42:01.911Z
No, it's crazy. And I mean, like. I mean, just on that. I remember the second one I did. Yeah, the second one I did.

2026-01-21T21:42:09.911Z
They had them, of course, throughout the course, but the last ones are at the finish line.

2026-01-21T21:42:14.071Z
Right? And they're just dangling down. I ran through them and one hit me, like, at the. On the back of my neck or the base of my. Somewhere, and it was like. I don't even. I haven't come up with words to describe.

2026-01-21T21:42:14.711Z
Yep, yep.

2026-01-21T21:42:17.031Z
Yep.

2026-01-21T21:42:27.751Z
How instantaneous I was on the ground.

2026-01-21T21:42:31.271Z
It was like all of a sudden, like, it was like, quantum, right? It was just like, boom. Like I was on the ground. So, yeah, so I started doing that, and then I just started running. I had some friends that did. I worked at a place that sponsored us to do some ragnars.

2026-01-21T21:42:32.231Z
100. 100%.

2026-01-21T21:42:46.791Z
Do you know? So does some road ragnar with work. And then also did trail some trail ragnars. And I've done a bunch of those. Like, I don't know, eight or ten of those.

2026-01-21T21:42:56.791Z
And then one year, a friend of mine and I. So There's a local 50 mile hour called the JFK 50.

2026-01-21T21:43:06.631Z
It's the oldest ultramarathon in the United States, and.

2026-01-21T21:43:11.911Z
It was sort of last minute. My friend was like, hey, we should do this.

2026-01-21T21:43:16.231Z
And I was like, yeah, sure. And we both wanted to register right on registration day because it was a very popular race and we had no idea whether it was going to sell out. Right. But we, at least I did basically zero research. Right. And that will come in. This will come into the story in a second.

2026-01-21T21:43:23.751Z
Wow.

2026-01-21T21:43:35.671Z
That's crazy.

2026-01-21T21:43:36.551Z
So we go, like, we go. And we just, like, you know, Google JFK 50 registration. Boom, click it. All right, like, Monday morning, 9:00am Whatever, March 1st. And you sign up and then you start getting emails and then you're like,

2026-01-21T21:43:49.031Z
Shit.

2026-01-21T21:43:50.391Z
It's JFK 50 mile, not JFK 50k. Literally, like, texting my friend Rob. I'm like, dude, did you know this? He's like, no, I didn't really realize it, but I didn't really look either. And so we were both like, all right, I guess we're in. It, you know, because it's. We registered in March and the races in November, so, like, we got time, you know, like, we don't know what we're getting ourselves into, but we got time. For him, that was his one and only 50. For me, that was just like. It broke the dam. I've. Done a couple of those. I've done a couple, I've done, yeah, I've done a couple, like solo efforts like, or like non organized races or not racist, but non organized efforts. So these are actually the cooler ones. So I've done a double traverse of the Grand Canyon.

2026-01-21T21:43:55.191Z
50K. That's what you.

2026-01-21T21:44:08.471Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:44:18.631Z
Yeah, it's addictive.

2026-01-21T21:44:40.871Z
Have you ever been to the Grand Canyon?

2026-01-21T21:44:43.831Z
Multiple times, but never down in the short hike, but never actually, like, properly all the way down.

2026-01-21T21:44:45.911Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:44:49.271Z
So. Yeah. So you know the power of that place.

2026-01-21T21:44:52.231Z
Right.

2026-01-21T21:44:53.271Z
Yeah. I mean, it doesn't even make sense. Yeah, it. Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:44:54.711Z
It's ridiculous. Yeah. And so I did in 2017 with my brothers in law and one of my brothers in law's brother.

2026-01-21T21:45:01.831Z
We did a multi day rim to rim hike. So like three days, two nights. Fabulous. So that's where I fell in love with the place.

2026-01-21T21:45:05.511Z
O.

2026-01-21T21:45:05.671Z
Kay.

2026-01-21T21:45:10.951Z
And I knew. I was like, I'm coming back here.

2026-01-21T21:45:13.591Z
And again, like this is. It's. It's one of those like best laid plans. It's another like comedy of error situation. So my idea was what I wanted to do. So the North Rim is fantastic. So you probably went to the south rim.

2026-01-21T21:45:25.671Z
Right. It's the touristy part.

2026-01-21T21:45:28.711Z
Y.

2026-01-21T21:45:29.271Z
It's where everyone goes. It's, like, the easiest to get to. There's lots of hotels right on the rim, the North Rim. There's one lodge.

2026-01-21T21:45:34.631Z
Ep.

2026-01-21T21:45:37.111Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:45:39.031Z
It just burned down in the past 18 months because of the fires out.

2026-01-21T21:45:43.271Z
Jeez.

2026-01-21T21:45:44.151Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:45:44.551Z
Yeah. No, it's ridiculous. So we wound up there, and this place is beautiful. Like, there's, like, sunset. We had, like, you know, cupped glasses of whiskey in our hands. It was like, I got to come back to this place. And so my idea was for me and my one of my brother in law brothers in law. Who was a runner? We would take. We and our wives. My sister and my wife would go. We would start at the South Rim, run to the North Rim. While we're running from the south to the north, our wives would do the drive.

2026-01-21T21:46:13.911Z
And then meet us at the North Rim, and then we'd spend two, three, four days at the North Rim. Well, I didn't get my act together and realized that you had to, like, reserve this lodge a year in advance and all this stuff. And I was like, so why don't we do it?

2026-01-21T21:46:26.871Z
Oh, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:46:31.191Z
Both ways.

2026-01-21T21:46:35.031Z
And he took he took a minute to decide, and he decided to do it with me, much to his credit, because he at the up to that point, he'd only ever done a marathon, and he hated it. He did it. He did the training, and we did it. And it was the longest single effort that I'VE done, but maybe.

2026-01-21T21:46:55.031Z
The best. I can't even come up with words. That was two years ago. Not this past October, but the previous October. So I guess a little over a year. Incredible. Just.

2026-01-21T21:47:06.231Z
Incredible.

2026-01-21T21:47:07.751Z
It rained.

2026-01-21T21:47:08.071Z
Yeah. I mean, that sounds like one of the things. Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:47:10.471Z
We had everything.

2026-01-21T21:47:12.231Z
Wow.

2026-01-21T21:47:13.591Z
I can just feel myself.

2026-01-21T21:47:17.271Z
So we did the Me and my. My brother and my wife.

2026-01-21T21:47:20.871Z
We did about. I think it was four days in the Dolomites before we went off to have some fun in Italy. And brother, like,

2026-01-21T21:47:26.551Z
My wife's Italian, so, yeah, dream of mine.

2026-01-21T21:47:28.951Z
I mean, what I pictured is you're down in the canyon. You have one minute of just, wow, this is amazing. Oh, my gosh, I'm so grateful. And then you look up and you have to do the other ascent, and you're, you know, you got your pack on your back and stuff, but, like. Also that feeling. I just. I crave that. Like you said, I mean, we've done a lot of adventuring. Not again, not a 50, but a lot of different hikes and crazy, like, things like that. And there's nothing like that I've had. I haven't found it.

2026-01-21T21:47:57.671Z
Yeah. No, I love that. And I love the. The. I mean, one. The one thing that sort of sucks about what I do is that my wife can't do it with me.

2026-01-21T21:48:06.151Z
Right? Like she will. She supports me. Right? And she, you know, she's out there and, you know, and actually, I just did a 50 in Moab in November, and she came out and did the 15k.

2026-01-21T21:48:16.631Z
But, you know, we're not doing it together. Whereas a hike through the Dolomites and again, like, that's bucket list for me. That's like every time one of my friends or Daniela and I's my wife talk about like, what do you like? I want to do a multi day hike through the dollar, right? And that's something that we can do together, right? Like hut to hut or whatever. Whatever you did, I'd love to hear more about that. And actually, you know, what the. What route you did, but that's the. The fact that you can do it with your wife and others makes that special.

2026-01-21T21:48:30.951Z
Yeah, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:48:32.071Z
Y.

2026-01-21T21:48:46.551Z
Eah. It was special. Yeah. And she doesn't. She doesn't run. But she loves a hike and she loves to camp. She's actually the best as far as starting fires in adverse conditions.

2026-01-21T21:48:56.951Z
I consider myself an experienced backpacker and. But that woman knows what to do. Like. So anyway, not running, not lifting, but loves to hike and camp. Same thing with. Have you done Yosemite?

2026-01-21T21:49:11.031Z
I've never been there.

2026-01-21T21:49:11.111Z
That was another one that's on. I mean, spending a few days out there, it's like Jurassic Park. It's the. It's the second coolest thing I've ever done behind. Behind the Dolomites in Italy. So, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:49:13.831Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:49:17.111Z
Right.

2026-01-21T21:49:23.991Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:49:24.631Z
Yeah, both. Both on the list, for sure.

2026-01-21T21:49:27.191Z
For sure.

2026-01-21T21:49:27.831Z
So I'll trade you. I'll go to the Grand Canyon, you show me the route, and then I'll be like, here's where we went through the door and we did Glen Allin. It's the Glenoline Pass. And like you said, you have to get your pass. Like, maybe not. A year in advance, but definitely many, many months. And that's the name of it, if you want to check it out.

2026-01-21T21:49:32.631Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:49:44.071Z
Okay. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. And if you ever are planning to do something, not necessarily what I did, but something in the Grand Canyon, let me know. I can definitely give you, you know, tips. There's not a whole lot of ways through the Grand Canyon, so it's pretty easy, but there are a few, you know. Insider tips that I could probably share with you. And, hell, I mean, I think. I think what I'm seeing sometime in the future is, you know, we go on some cool hike together.

2026-01-21T21:49:55.431Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:50:07.751Z
But anyway.

2026-01-21T21:50:08.631Z
Dude, let's do it.

2026-01-21T21:50:09.271Z
We'll get there.

2026-01-21T21:50:10.071Z
Heck.

2026-01-21T21:50:10.391Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:50:10.471Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:50:12.551Z
Especially if it's one that's a first.

2026-01-21T21:50:14.791Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:50:15.271Z
For both of us.

2026-01-21T21:50:15.831Z
Yeah, yeah, no, that would be great. Agreed.

2026-01-21T21:50:16.231Z
That'd be.

2026-01-21T21:50:18.151Z
And my brother, he's. My brother's crazy. So we went running with the bulls this year earlier in May, and my brother.

2026-01-21T21:50:23.671Z
Nice.

2026-01-21T21:50:25.751Z
Amazing.

2026-01-21T21:50:26.311Z
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, like, that actually, that wasn't as. Actually, it was really athletic. But that is, like, a surreal thing because, like, you see it on kind of tv, you hear it in movies and shows.

2026-01-21T21:50:38.711Z
But you're there, and there's like 3,000 people.

2026-01-21T21:50:41.511Z
And like these crazy giant creatures that are faster and stronger and meaner than you thought and you're in a 10 foot space that they have to get through, so there's no escape.

2026-01-21T21:50:50.951Z
And then you go. If you make it into the stadium and you run the mile and a half or whatever, they trap you in the stadium and then re release the bulls. And that's what everyone is watching. Like what you see on TV is everyone looking at you, not being able to escape, running away from even more. Bulls. And then everyone just parties. They party like you wouldn't expect at like 9 in the morning, dude, all day long.

2026-01-21T21:50:51.671Z
Right.

2026-01-21T21:51:12.471Z
Sure.

2026-01-21T21:51:13.831Z
I would too, if I made it through.

2026-01-21T21:51:16.551Z
That. Did you make it to the arena?

2026-01-21T21:51:19.591Z
Yeah, I was a running back in high school and I read. So, yeah, I was like stiff armored people and hurtling. Yeah, my distinct. My specific life, like lifestyle and training came in handy. But that's how people get hurt. Few people die from the bulls. They die from getting trampled. Basically, yeah. Anyway, where was I? Going with that? Oh, yeah. So I would love to do something like that. And my brother, he. He is like a mountaineer. Like, he. He'll go and just scale mountains. Like, right after we did the bulls, he flew to Switzerland and did, like, I think it was like 12,000ft on ice.

2026-01-21T21:51:24.391Z
Correct.

2026-01-21T21:51:37.591Z
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:51:57.911Z
Like it didn't even make any sense. So that's the kind of stuff that guy does if you want him to tag along.

2026-01-21T21:52:02.071Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:52:03.271Z
I. I mean, I'd rather him tag along with us than me tag along with him, because that sounds. That sounds more intense than I want to get.

2026-01-21T21:52:12.071Z
He's crazy. He likes to boulder too. Like without a rope up these crazy cliff face.

2026-01-21T21:52:14.311Z
Y.

2026-01-21T21:52:17.831Z
I watched those. My wife and I like to watch all kinds of climbing and bouldering, all those videos on YouTube, but I have very little desire to do it right. Like, I like watching Alex Donald. Like, he's about to do something on Netflix this Friday. He's about to do. He's about to do. A live in Taipei.

2026-01-21T21:52:30.391Z
Dame.

2026-01-21T21:52:33.351Z
Another one.

2026-01-21T21:52:37.111Z
I think he's going to do the Taipei Tower.

2026-01-21T21:52:39.751Z
I mean, free solo is probably top 50 of movie show. It's whatever you want to call it. Experiences for me. I re watch it often. That's so cool.

2026-01-21T21:52:48.311Z
Yeah, I want to see that. My wife has zero interest. Like, she. She doesn't want to watch it once, but I want to see it in IMAX or something like that.

2026-01-21T21:52:57.351Z
Or at the sphere in vegas.

2026-01-21T21:52:58.231Z
That'd be so sick.

2026-01-21T21:53:00.471Z
That's a good tip. I didn't even realize I was going on. It's like when I watched that, it reminds me of just, like how dope and capable, like, we have to do our lives. There's the day to day stuff, but then it's like, oh, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:53:11.351Z
Like, we can do that stuff, too. Like, you know what I mean?

2026-01-21T21:53:12.951Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:53:14.071Z
And the thing that I like about him is that, like, he's. He does it.

2026-01-21T21:53:18.391Z
I don't know what the story is about. The Taipei thing. This is a little out of character from what I know about him. But he's very like. He goes on these adventures. But he has a nonprofit as well, right? He gives, like, some large percentage of his income.

2026-01-21T21:53:31.751Z
Away to climate and other. Other causes. And so he'll do these adventures. But part of the adventure is like him and his team going and putting up solar.

2026-01-21T21:53:42.151Z
You know, and, like, bringing running water to a village or whatever it is, right? They're not just going in, helicopter in, make a YouTube video to make some money and then, you know, fly out. So he seems like he's doing it the right way, so I respect that.

2026-01-21T21:53:47.671Z
Wow.

2026-01-21T21:53:57.111Z
I didn't even know that. Respect them even more now.

2026-01-21T21:53:57.671Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:53:59.031Z
Yeah, yeah. No, he's a good guy.

2026-01-21T21:54:01.431Z
What is it? Yeah, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:54:03.911Z
What are they saying? He, like his amygdala doesn't fire correctly or like it's malformed or something. He just, like, literally doesn't perceive.

2026-01-21T21:54:12.311Z
Fear or risk the same way. It's so awesome.

2026-01-21T21:54:14.311Z
Yeah, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:54:14.951Z
Yeah, I think he just habituated to it, you know, like, he's just been doing. He's probably been doing it since he was 12, you know, like.

2026-01-21T21:54:18.951Z
That, too.

2026-01-21T21:54:19.991Z
Yep.

2026-01-21T21:54:21.111Z
It's like. Yes, like whatever the reverse of ptsd is.

2026-01-21T21:54:27.191Z
Dude, so, you know, hard pivot. But I always, like. You know, I love. I'm a sucker for an origin story. And, like, me and you have kind of talked about more of what we're doing now, but I'm just curious of, like, what has brought you to this point of even working with, like. I didn't look at your background because I like to hear it from people versus snooping. You know? Do you have an engineering background? Were you like a math nerd or you're just like AI's dope? It's up and coming. I'm going to like, dive into this stuff. You know what I mean?

2026-01-21T21:54:36.871Z
Y.

2026-01-21T21:54:37.031Z
Eah.

2026-01-21T21:54:46.951Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:54:57.271Z
So, I mean.

2026-01-21T21:54:59.511Z
Let me give you the quick, full version.

2026-01-21T21:55:04.071Z
So I was a really bad student in high school.

2026-01-21T21:55:06.951Z
Didn't go to college right away.

2026-01-21T21:55:10.551Z
It was basically forced into helping my dad start a business because he had been laid off. Did that for two years.

2026-01-21T21:55:17.031Z
Went to art school because they didn't have a math or language requirement. So it was basically, I was, like, taking the easy way out. Like, I was, you know, I was a photography major.

2026-01-21T21:55:27.751Z
And lived in New York City. That was when I lived in New York City, and that was during the. So that was between 94 and 98. So that was a commercialization of the Internet. As I'm older than I Look, I'm 51.

2026-01-21T21:55:38.471Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:55:40.151Z
And so it was during the commercialization of the Internet, and I found myself actually, like, wanting to send pictures home to my parents to show them what I was doing, teaching myself how to do HTML and put things online. And that essentially launched my career. So was the first technical hire of a husband and wife team running a marketing agency in D.C. became one of the top marketing agencies in D.C. for a period. Left there, went into, like, did some teaching, did some product consulting, and then that was when I did my first startup, I guess really my only real startup in the corporate wellness space.

2026-01-21T21:56:23.511Z
And so learned a ton doing that. Right. That was 2009 to 2013 or so. And then went back into the corporate world and just, you know, ran development and marketing and sales teams for the next.

2026-01-21T21:56:36.391Z
Did you. Did you sell that? Did you exit? Or is it still going like for this?

2026-01-21T21:56:39.911Z
That's a whole nother story that involved, like, dying and, like, a bunch of other stuff.

2026-01-21T21:56:41.991Z
Okay?

2026-01-21T21:56:44.871Z
And so, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:56:47.591Z
And. But, like, I mean, still valuable, right?

2026-01-21T21:56:51.111Z
And then.

2026-01-21T21:56:55.191Z
After, like, a handful of years in the corporate world. Back in the corporate world, I took a year off, so I took a career gap year. Like, it was. I wasn't just laid off and I took a year off and did a bunch of cool stuff.

2026-01-21T21:57:09.111Z
And.

2026-01-21T21:57:12.071Z
Decided that I was going to reorient my career towards music.

2026-01-21T21:57:16.551Z
And did that for the next seven years. So I ran sales and marketing at Americas, the second largest record pressing plant in North America.

2026-01-21T21:57:27.191Z
Which was just spawned in the past two years by Metallica. A super fun experience, very short.

2026-01-21T21:57:32.071Z
Awesome.

2026-01-21T21:57:34.151Z
Lived experience because I didn't get me in. The CEO just didn't, didn't mesh. And then most recently, it leads us up to present day. I ran all like I was a one man team. I don't want to make it seem bigger than it was. It was a one man team, ran all customer facing and revenue everything for a 10 person direct to consumer manufacturer of very not very for most people vary in this world.

2026-01-21T21:57:41.431Z
Recently.

2026-01-21T21:58:01.591Z
High end home audio tube amplifiers.

2026-01-21T21:58:06.071Z
I don't even know what that is.

2026-01-21T21:58:07.431Z
So just like, like, hi, Fi.

2026-01-21T21:58:12.071Z
High Fidelity audio.

2026-01-21T21:58:14.391Z
Oh, okay. I understand. Yeah, yeah.

2026-01-21T21:58:17.351Z
And this amplifiers that, like, have vacuum tubes sticking out of them.

2026-01-21T21:58:21.671Z
So, like, literally made by hand, you buy it and you get it a month later. Like, you Everything's by order. Got laid off after we had our most successful product launch ever the previous year, and our biggest year ever by far, got laid off the March after that year. If you know anything about manufacturing, there's a. I can explain why that would happen. Basically, cash flow and. And.

2026-01-21T21:58:50.151Z
Oh. Yep.

2026-01-21T21:58:53.511Z
Then took a week or two to be like, what the is going on?

2026-01-21T21:58:58.231Z
And basically found myself. This is why I started so early. Found myself in a similar situation as in the mid-90s, where you look around you and you say if. If you were given an opportunity to start over at this point, which I was, what would you go into? And the answer is obvious, right? It's neon. Signs flashing all over the place, Right? It's AI. And so I just went all in on AI. I was like, you know, I didn't have a job.

2026-01-21T21:59:20.391Z
I mean.

2026-01-21T21:59:21.991Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:59:23.191Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:59:28.631Z
I had, you know, I had some Runway in terms of, you know, I didn't have to, like, start making money like this second. And so it was like, eight hours a day, like, learning, building YouTube, everything that I.

2026-01-21T21:59:41.911Z
Yeah. What did you start with? Yeah, yeah. What was your entry point? Like, what was the gateway drug for you?

2026-01-21T21:59:47.031Z
Was it a chat bot? Was it automation? Yeah.

2026-01-21T21:59:48.231Z
Have.

2026-01-21T21:59:48.631Z
Been. I had been using chatgpt like I see people using chatgpt today. I had been using it.

2026-01-21T21:59:55.831Z
In my regular job, you know, like, redoing copy and, you know, things like that. I think it was innate. N was probably the, like, I'm not an innate in expert, but that was the, like, first YouTube rabbit hole that I went down that was like, showed me, like, oh, okay, right. Like, there's more. Than just these chatbots, right? And I can. I can sort of, sort of start to see the possibilities for business and other things. So, yeah, that was it. And so, yeah, it's been there. And then right around. So, like, sometime in the summer, I was like, all right, Training, I think, is my thing. I really have. Enjoyed teaching in the past, and there's a huge need for it, and I can apply it to sort of anything. And then it took me another couple few months to niche down to say, like, you can't just say like, I do AI training.

2026-01-21T22:00:14.471Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T22:00:16.871Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T22:00:35.111Z
Yeah.

2026-01-21T22:00:45.111Z
Because that's whatever. So, like, doing AI training for sales and marketing teams and then. And just now to the point where I'm getting, like, my first couple clients and, you know, actual paying clients and things like that. So I'm at the very beginning stages of, of an actual business around AI, but that's the story.

2026-01-21T22:01:06.711Z
That's the probably longer story than you.

2026-01-21T22:01:08.231Z
I think that's awesome, dude.

2026-01-21T22:01:09.511Z
I mean, that sounds like what? Not that it's easy, but like, what? What a natural, like, progression, I guess. Like that feels very right. And I do love N8 and it has a special place on her. I've always. I'm a huge zapier Stan, and as soon as I saw any, then I was like, okay.

2026-01-21T22:01:25.671Z
AI's apier. Got it. And it. That's like the experience that people hate it.

2026-01-21T22:01:29.511Z
But I'm like,

2026-01-21T22:01:31.431Z
Do you not understand? Like, sure, the learning curve is a little, you know, steeper than you want. But, like, do you understand just, like, with Purser? Like, people don't seem to like cursor or Claude code. And I'm like, but if you just, like, spend a month, just spend a week.

2026-01-21T22:01:35.831Z
See a difference.

2026-01-21T22:01:48.071Z
Just build a thing. It's amazing. So kudos to you, man. Do you have any clients you have so far?

2026-01-21T22:01:55.191Z
What's up?

2026-01-21T22:01:55.511Z
I have two active ones that I'm trying to.

2026-01-21T22:01:58.071Z
Give me one second.

2026-01-21T22:01:58.951Z
Of course.

2026-01-21T22:01:59.511Z
Nick. I'll be right back.

2026-01-21T22:02:00.711Z
Take. Go for it.

2026-01-21T22:04:48.951Z
Dude, I am so sorry. Bit of an emergency. Let's book some more time, though, okay? This was great. I apologize.

2026-01-21T22:04:54.551Z
100 because I've done all the talking.

2026-01-21T22:04:58.311Z
No, I. I've enjoyed it. I just. I got to get going. Take care of my life, like I said. But I appreciate it, man. Good talking to you.

2026-01-21T22:05:00.951Z
Do you think?

2026-01-21T22:05:03.671Z
Yeah, yeah. Connect soon.
