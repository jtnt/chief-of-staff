**20:00:39**
You have a Nicholas or nick?

**20:00:41**
I'm Nicholas, so it makes it easy for us.

**20:00:43**
Okay, good.

**20:00:45**
My grandfather was Nick. That's the joke I always. The bad joke that I always tell is that the reason why I go by Nicholas is my grandfather was Nick. And otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell us apart.

**20:00:57**
I got spared that my brother was the one who was named after our great grandfather.

**20:01:01**
So.

**20:01:03**
Yeah. The name goes back to my great, great grandfather, who was George Nicholas Segmuller.

**20:01:11**
So, yeah, on my mom's side.

**20:01:14**
How's it going? Thanks for connecting today.

**20:01:17**
Yeah, no worries. Sorry things have been so hectic for you.

**20:01:21**
Yeah. No, it's good. It's all good things.

**20:01:25**
At a client that I got to Dallas for, and then I'm just trying to follow up with them and trying to get more business.

**20:01:33**
Why don't we start off with. We can remind each other what is raining and. We were far away from each other on Saturday when we met.

**20:01:42**
Yeah.

**20:01:44**
Sure.

**20:01:44**
I can go first.

**20:01:49**
I was earning, like, a W2 job up until, like, May of last year. I was doing, like, science policy type stuff. Specifically, I was a science policy fellow at the National Science Foundation.

**20:01:59**
And I was working on, like, AI R&D funding and, and the sort of tumult of, like, administration change. I left and decided I wanted to do an AI startup.

**20:02:09**
In particular, education focused because I've been around sort of talent issues.

**20:02:13**
Contracting for DoD and then working for NSF that whole time. And I think this AI stuff is important for normal people to understand.

**20:02:22**
So maybe against, like, better wisdom, I left and tried to do this company without any experience sort of working and like a startup or really much of the private sector.

**20:02:34**
Kind of iterated on, like, I like what I wanted to teach in that sort of space for about a couple of months.

**20:02:41**
And ended up finding a couple of friends who agreed to be part time with me on teaching Workers so Adult Workforce Literacy.

**20:02:51**
And I spent, like, several months last year, most of the last year, trying to, like, build an online platform that essentially would let people go through, like, a wizard and learn how to use chatbots for different stuff.

**20:03:05**
And I purposely did not try to do, like, in person trainings or anything like that because I figured that area was pretty, like, saturated, but that hasn't really gotten me a lot of traction.

**20:03:15**
Much.

**20:03:17**
So I decided to ask my co founders actually to step down. Both of them ended up being busier than I think they intended, working full time jobs outside of that.

**20:03:25**
And to do more, like, workforce trainings in person and specifically over, like, the holidays into this month. I've been focusing a lot on Claude code type stuff, and I guess now it'll be Claude cowork for things. So I'm running a big, like, online training next week. It was originally supposed to be at the library, but we had too many people sign up. And I discovered the Internet at the library blocks a lot of secure connections, so a lot of stuff doesn't work there.

**20:03:55**
And then I'm planning to follow it up with more like hackathon type things like project nights and other stuff.

**20:04:02**
I run some other, like, meetups and things. Like, I run, like, an AI dinner series. That's a lot of, like, AI policy and technology people.

**20:04:09**
But that I do for fun. That's not a part of the work.

**20:04:11**
And then I also run, like, an industrial policy meetup that's starting recently.

**20:04:17**
But, yeah, that's most of it.

**20:04:20**
Still building online modules and things like that, but essentially I'm all in on education for non coding workers.

**20:04:28**
Great.

**20:04:29**
It's great. That session I saw, it was so popular and so big that it wouldn't fit in the library. That's great. That was paid, right?

**20:04:41**
I originally intended to do. Sorry. It's free. That's a short answer. I intended to do it as a trial and then do a paid version if it went well.

**20:04:43**
Okay?

**20:04:49**
But, yeah, it sort of, like, metastasis. Like, there were more people on the waitlist than, like, I was actually planning to allow into the event, so I ended up just having to open it.

**20:04:57**
Yeah.

**20:04:59**
Well, it's a good signal at the very least.

**20:05:06**
Let me see. I got laid off at my last job. So I have a varied career, right? So I'm going back all the way to college.

**20:05:15**
I went to art school, but I was a self taught coder turned that into.

**20:05:21**
The first section of my career.

**20:05:25**
And then went into had my own startup for four or five years and the corporate wellness space selling to large companies and did some teaching back then, like continuing teaching through Boston University, and really enjoyed teaching, doing it that way.

**20:05:45**
And I also did some products consulting for startups during those years.

**20:05:52**
And really sort of cut my teeth there, sort of helping doing the product side. And then when I was a founder, of course, founder means I would always joke that CEO means chief everything officer. So that was where I got that was all founder led sales. Before it was called founder led sales. It's just called sales and this was back in 2009-2013 14.

**20:06:18**
And then we're back into the corporate world.

**20:06:22**
And again was leading marketing teams, product teams and sales teams.

**20:06:30**
And then.

**20:06:31**
Left that and basically got burnout and took a year off.

**20:06:36**
And then I decided I was going to reorient my career at that point to music rather than just sort of go into the same progression that had burned me out previously. And so did that for the past seven years or so after the year off. And I did a bunch of cool stuff during the year off.

**20:06:59**
Then just got laid off in March of that last music related job. And again, all those jobs were marketing, sales. They were in different realms. The last one actually was interesting, was direct to consumer, which I had never done before.

**20:07:16**
And so my experience sort of spans B2B and D to C. I have not done any government like B to G work, so I know nothing about federal sales or anything like that.

**20:07:29**
If I had, I probably would have applied to the anthropic and OpenAI jobs that they have offered.

**20:07:35**
Because I could probably retire in a couple years just on the salary.

**20:07:39**
Y.

**20:07:39**
Eah.

**20:07:43**
And then in house at agencies. Also in house and at agencies.

**20:07:51**
And I have never really worked at a really large company. The biggest company I've ever worked at is 200 people.

**20:07:58**
But then across a bunch of different.

**20:08:03**
Disciplines. Right. Departments. So I would say my strength is translating between worlds with respect and knowledge and empathy. Right. So I can come in. I can. Usually at this point, I'm in the sales and marketing sphere, but I can talk to if I'm coming in and talking to the cmo, I can talk to the CTO without them being like, oh, who is this marketing idiot, right? And then likewise, I can talk to the CEO and talk at their sort of strategic level.

**20:08:41**
And without being like, oh, they don't get it because I've done all those roles.

**20:08:46**
At a pretty deep level this past March. Got laid off. I had been using AI in my job for quite a while, but it was still pretty sporadic. It was like, oh, let me write these ads or rewrite this website copy, that kind of thing. Never really systematized it. It was just a tool. And when I got laid off pretty quickly. I was like, all right, if you've been given the chance to start over, where would you start over? Where would you put your energy? And the answer is obvious, right? AI? Similarly, when I did that with the Internet in the mid-90s when I was in college,

**20:09:24**
And it took me a while to sort of figure out sort of where I was going to focus my efforts. For a while, I just put my head down and was learning and building and doing things. I wasn't doing anything around, like, all right, how am I going to expose this or offer this to the world?

**20:09:41**
Yeah.

**20:09:44**
And then once I figured out, okay, there's a big gap and there's going to be a need and an ongoing need, a growing need for training.

**20:09:56**
I was like, okay, that's an area that I enjoy doing. I think it's a relatively easy area to get into, and I can use some of my prior teaching experience. I can use my just general skills to do that, and so start out very general. And it's like, okay, AI training for everybody, and then it took me a few months to narrow that down to say, okay, that's way too general. Like, if you're out of. I'm at a networking event or something, and I'm saying, like, I do AI training. People just sort of nod their head and it's sort of like, yeah, everybody. Does AI training, right? It's like saying you're an AI consultant.

**20:10:38**
But once I sort of niched down into AI training for sales and marketing, or sometimes I say gtm. That's when people are like, oh, okay, right? And they say like, oh, I know somebody who's VP of marketing over here or CRO at this company. And they can sort of connect the dots a little bit better. And so that was good, but that was.

**20:11:03**
Like sometime in October that I really figured that out and started to tell people.

**20:11:08**
And so now, just over the past or similar to you, maybe like the last month and a half, two months, starting like my first real client engagements.

**20:11:20**
People actually paying me to do this. Bring me in.

**20:11:23**
And so I'm learning a lot. And then I also have these through some of the work that I've been doing with clients and just thinking about all this stuff and building things on my own.

**20:11:36**
I've come up with some concepts and ways that I think like, okay, these are outside of just training. These are ways that companies can use, can get the most out of the AI tools. And a lot of what I'm focusing on now are, is around context. And you may have seen my post, you know, a couple recent posts about context profiles and things like that, and I think there's a lot of opportunity there. Everyone's talking about it.

**20:12:04**
Now, right? I mean, there's all that context graph stuff, which I think is way.

**20:12:10**
Yeah, yeah.

**20:12:12**
But I'm sort of seeing. And then there's the context graph, right? Which is, like, super complex and, you know, super fascinating, frankly. And I'm incorporating it into my thinking, but not really focusing on it as, like, a service offering or a product offering.

**20:12:27**
But that's what I'm sort of thinking about is how do I.

**20:12:30**
How do I offer this as a service offering or a product offering, either separately or in conjunction with training or just in general AI enablement at a company? And like, I just got another signal yesterday, so I was running an AI workflow build sprint with a GTM team for a local B2B startup. There are about 200 people. The GTM team is like 40 or 50 people. And it culminated into. They had a sales kickoff yesterday, today and yesterday. And I went out and moderated the session where the teams were presenting what they built, and essentially they just built custom GPTs, and that's where most people are actually like, I can tell you some stories that will just sort of align where, like, this is a company where, like. And I think we maybe texted about this, but.

**20:13:25**
They are an AI company. Their sales intel, you can look in that, you can, you can look into what they do, but they have sort of AI infused products. It's sales data signal, you know, based sales data.

**20:13:39**
And so, like, very smart company, like.

**20:13:42**
Bunch of engineers. They use AI, the CEO, super smart.

**20:13:46**
But.

**20:13:48**
Their sales and marketing, their GTM team are what you would expect. A normal winch of 20 something, you know, AES, BDRs, things like that. And like one of them literally had never used AI in his life.

**20:14:04**
And there were some people that were so unfamiliar with the landscape that when I was saying Claude, I did a lunch and learn for them, a couple, like, you know, a month or so ago, they thought I was saying the word clause with like. Like Santa Claus, like with an e. And so that was.

**20:14:22**
Eye opening. And it's. Every time I go in front of people, it's eye opening. Like, one of the very first trainings I did, like, over the summer, it was just two people at an architecture firm of trying to get them to do the whole firm.

**20:14:35**
Like the partner, smart guy, right? Like he runs the architecture firm, you know, like he's in Brooklyn. It's a 30 person firm, you know, super smart guy. He's an architect and he had used AI and it was his director of operations she was using regularly for certain things, but neither one of them had. Ever switched the model in. They were using ChatGPT. They didn't even know that they could switch the model. I'd never even clicked the button to switch the model.

**20:15:03**
And had never and didn't know projects existed.

**20:15:08**
So it's just like every time I'm put in front of real people, real people, I'm remembering, like, you know, my old software days, my own website testing days, where it's just like, don't make people think, right? And people won't think so anyway.

**20:15:23**
That was a tangent. Sorry, but so, like, sticking on around the context side and thinking about it, it threw the lens of not a complex. Like you can make it super complex and you can make it super techie, right? Like connect to all your internal data, right? Like basically try to build glean again.

**20:15:26**
That's interesting.

**20:15:43**
But I think where most companies are is we just need some solid.

**20:15:50**
Context documents.

**20:15:51**
That are well structured and have some sort of ontology on them, that we can give access to the people so that they can load into.

**20:16:03**
The chat bots.

**20:16:06**
And like, that's going to. There's a large enough swath of people that I can, I think I can sort of generate some business, you know, just offering that even just as a manual service of like $5,000 to do that or whatever it is. Right. To build that for you. But then also of course, I'm thinking about how to, at the very least, for me, build a tool to, like, help me do it right if I do, you know, start getting clients that want to do that and then sort of productizing it, you know, in some way, and I haven't really put a whole lot of thought to. That. So, anyway, that's where I am, and I was excited. One of my New Year's resolutions was to get out and, like, connect with more people. Because nothing happens when I'm sitting here in my guest bedroom, you know, just, you know, bang away on Claude code or whatever.

**20:16:56**
Yeah.

**20:16:56**
From my apartment.

**20:16:57**
Totally. So this, like, that AI walks was part of it. You know, I'm basically. I'm. I'm meeting with, you know, several people a week.

**20:17:07**
Just to get the word out. So, anyway, that's where I am.

**20:17:11**
Interesting. Yeah, I. I have a lot of questions, but first off, I'm just going to agree with you, like a resolution to meet more people.

**20:17:17**
I feel like that's something I say a lot to people that I meet nowadays. It's like, it's so easy to produce content that paradoxically, like, the value talking to people has gone way, way up. It's so much harder to sift information.

**20:17:26**
Dog.

**20:17:28**
A good way to put it.

**20:17:30**
Yeah, so I've been trying to, like, do more meetup organizing and stuff, like this industrial policy thing and some other things.

**20:17:34**
Yeah, yeah.

**20:17:37**
Great. Especially your age, Right? Like, I'm, like, there's something about, like. So I'm 51.

**20:17:44**
I like to think that I'm older than I look. And so it's like I remember when I was. I imagine you're somewhere in your 20s, it seems.

**20:17:54**
I'm 33, but close.

**20:17:55**
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So you. Likewise. You're. You're looking good.

**20:18:02**
So it was easier for me when I was 33 to, you know, go out and do the meetups and connect. And it's not. I don't have any kids or anything. It's not logistically easier. It's just like, you know, mentally easier to get out. So I'm just trying to push myself to do that more, connect with more people, because that's where the real magic happens. And you meet people that can help you, and you get your ideas out in a different way.

**20:18:23**
Yeah.

**20:18:25**
Yeah, that's the funny thing is I feel like I enjoy that aspect quite a bit and I feel like I'm decent at it. The hard part is getting from, like, the. The good personal connections to, like, making a business connection or something, or like, actually generating a sale.

**20:18:37**
Yeah.

**20:18:38**
I found that to be harder for me.

**20:18:40**
Personally. Maybe because I'm just so antsy about trying to monetize my personal network. Or I'm not very good at building a non friendly but like, professional network.

**20:18:50**
Sure, sure. No, it's. It's a tough line to cross because I'm the same way. I never want to seem like I'm using anyone, right? Or, like, have an angle or something like that.

**20:18:59**
Yeah.

**20:19:02**
And because, frankly, I value the personal connections way more anyway. Right? Like, I would always. I would always, like, you know, forego that.

**20:19:07**
Yeah.

**20:19:12**
But, I mean, one way, like, I had a. I had a good conversation, actually, earlier today with one of the people that was at the AI Walks meetup, and he worked at ID Me. And there's certainly an opportunity there for me, it sounds like people like you and me to get in and do some training on a department level and things like that.

**20:19:35**
And the way that I approached it to him was I said, like, look, I just want to learn about.

**20:19:41**
Like, for my like.

**20:19:43**
I just want to learn about what he. What is going on at the company. What he had been doing to. Because he said that he was sort of taking upon itself himself to be like an AI evangelist at the company.

**20:19:56**
And so I approached him at the AI walk and said, like, you know, I just.

**20:20:00**
Want to for my own benefit, you know, And I was really open to him about it. I was like, you know, this is what I do, and I'd love to learn about what you all are doing, what you specifically are doing, what's worked, what hasn't. You know, what. What's the activity going on there. And then he was really open about it. And we had a call today, and he was super open with that. And the good thing there was that he was already. He was telling me, like,

**20:20:24**
This is a potential place or avenue to get you in here, right?

**20:20:30**
And so I was. And. And so I take the tack of, all right, like, I'm. And I'm gonna. I'm not gonna go in trying to be like, get me in. Get me in. I'm just gonna sort of think, if you're willing to share information, then that's enough for. Me and then be super thankful and grateful for that, and then hopefully it works out. But, yeah, at some point, you do have to just, like, you just have to sell. Not sell, but you just have to close the deal and be like, hey, can you do this for me? Right? You know, and that's where I'VE gotten. I've gotten better at over the years. And a good way of doing it is being like. I had a call with a startup guy, he's out in San Francisco, and he's developing a product around this sort of stuff, around the context stuff.

**20:21:15**
For product and engineering teams.

**20:21:18**
And I was getting towards the end of the call, and I was like, look, you know, I have two questions for you.

**20:21:26**
What can I do to help you?

**20:21:30**
And I like to tell you what you can do to help me.

**20:21:35**
And it was basically just, you know, introduced me to people in your network that can, you know, that have this, you know, and it gave him a really defined area, but it's sort of like, hey, like, I want to help you, and I will actively help you.

**20:21:49**
But also, let me tell you how you can help me too, right? And that sort of as long as you've connected with the person on a good level on the call before that.

**20:21:59**
I found that that works in terms of being like. All right, like, look, it's. We're really open. We're both want to get something out of this, right? You know, it's not just, you know, we're looking for a new friend. Although that would be great, you know, like, we are. We. Are both working on things and trying to push things forward. But it is a hard.

**20:22:18**
Line to toe.

**20:22:21**
Yeah.

**20:22:22**
I don't think I. We're your first clients. Like, people that you met this way, or did you know them from, like, your previous jobs or.

**20:22:27**
It was all warm. Yeah, totally. And that's the way it's going to be. Like, I'm not. I'm not cold emailing or DMing or doing anything like that. Right. It's all, like, you know, reaching out to my, like, literally, like, friends and family.

**20:22:42**
And I mean, the funny thing is, is that I think I mentioned this at the, at the turnaround on the AI walk. It's like, look, you know, my go to market strategy is if you go to my website, it says AI training for sales and marketing teams, right?

**20:22:56**
But the practical reality of it is is that I've done as much training for non sales and marketing teams and just general people like, you know, general, you know, audiences in a company as I have for sales and marketing. So yeah, like that's where the law firm, or, sorry, the architecture firm came from. It's where a law firm came from trying to get my wife to get me into her company because of reasonably large company and they are in the same boat.

**20:23:24**
That a million companies are now which is they're using it but sporadic and you know you know the deal haven't systematized it so working it there I have some friends like I haven't done is I need I need to.

**20:23:38**
And, and this is where that line comes in that we were talking about and this, like, uncomfortableness. Like, there is a group of friends that I have that.

**20:23:48**
Could probably help me. They're, like, quite wealthy. They're quite high up in their jobs.

**20:23:54**
But they are my personal friends. And so I do just want to, you know, I just need to come up with the right text message, basically be like, hey, guys, like, I don't normally do this, but. Right. Like, I'm starting a business. You know, can you help me out? Right. And the funny thing is, is. That those people, especially these guys, they'd all be like, oh, yeah, sure, whatever you need, man. You know, it's those, like, it's the. It's the ones that you maybe don't know as much, that you know are probably a little harder because, like, oh, I've known these guys for. You know, a decade or more.

**20:24:25**
Yeah.

**20:24:27**
But I need more of that. Like, that's, again, one of my resolutions. And I have a guy that I meet with. It was the Monday morning guy that I meet at that sauna place. And we sort of. We are both, like, keeping each other accountable because it's both. Both of us find it hard to. Do that outreach, like, we've. We both want to just sort of descend into our cave and build something or write something or whatever, so, yeah.

**20:24:27**
Yeah.

**20:24:28**
Yeah.

**20:24:51**
Yeah, I actually feel that way, too. I feel like education. I also have this, like, inherent intention of. I believe just a lot of people should know this and that it shouldn't, like, be a major barrier to, like, have to pay to, like, know this thing, so. And then I end up competing against people who are literally like nonprofits or things like that, where they are just trying to disseminate it at some minimal cost.

**20:25:04**
Right.

**20:25:13**
And so, yeah, part of me feels guilty charging anything at all.

**20:25:17**
Yeah, I hear that. But you're providing. You're providing value, right?

**20:25:21**
And, you know, a way that you might. And this is just, you know, I'm just, like, coming up. I've seen this before, but lots of places have, like, they charge whatever it is.

**20:25:31**
But then they'll have, like, you know, if.

**20:25:35**
You're out of a job or part of a group, blah, blah, blah, Right? Like, we offer scholarships, right? And it's basically, email me and I'll give it to you for free if, you know, I think you deserve it, right? Or if you've got a. You've got a sad enough story. So that can sort of. Because you've got to, you know, you got to pay your bills, but, yeah, you've got to keep your soul alive, too. Right. And make sure that you're, you know, doing things that align with your. Your own morals, for sure.

**20:25:48**
Yeah.

**20:25:48**
Yeah.

**20:26:02**
Yeah, that's true.

**20:26:05**
And I'm kind of doing something like that for the dinner series that I run. I've been paying for all the food out of my own pocket, and it's. It's fun. I enjoy the dinners a lot. I usually get around, like, 20 to 30 people or so who show up, but.

**20:26:11**
Oh, well, yeah.

**20:26:19**
A lot of people to buy food for. I always think he was like seven people or something.

**20:26:23**
Oh, no. It kind of, like, started that way. Like, we just started going to a restaurant, but then it kind of got too big. I know some people who have, like, a townhouse, so we usually just, like, use their second floor and host there. But I didn't. I just get, like, a bunch of food from Costco. Where I cook something, like in bulk.

**20:26:38**
But I've been relying on volunteers, like, hey, you know, can you like, pay me back for some of this? And like, some people are good about it and then others, like, they'll remember with controlling and others just aren't on the chats or don't remember to do it at all.

**20:26:51**
So now I'm just putting up a paywall for purposes of, like, buying food. But I told people, you can just message me for a coupon code.

**20:26:59**
Right.

**20:27:00**
And let them in.

**20:27:00**
But that's like, kind of table stakes.

**20:27:02**
Right.

**20:27:04**
Yeah. And some. Some things I kind of want to do, maybe as a public service to begin with. And then maybe part of me is unclear if it's like I go to market strategy or if it'll just lead to more calls for free stuff. But, like, one of the things I want to do, for example, is run like a staffer's, like demonstration. Because I happen to know several people from when I was AAAS fellow who are in Congress now and other people who are just sort of working on a policy or even like non AI policy. And just a lot of them don't really viscerally I think understand what this systems are capable of. Now, a lot of them still think that systems are basically like you said, like the free version of ChatGPT. They haven't really experimented much.

**20:27:43**
So I'm trying to, like, set up a demo for them.

**20:27:45**
Yeah, I think that's a great idea. I mean, this client, the sales intel client I got. Well, actually, it's. It's two things that we have been talking about that should encourage me to do those things more. So, one, I met the CEO at a local like sales and marketing and customer success summit. Put on by a local group that does, like, sales training and stuff.

**20:28:13**
And again, it was one of those things where it's like, it was on my calendar. I knew I was going to do it. I paid for it. It wasn't crazy expensive, but it did cost me some money. So it's like, all right, I got to actually go to this versus just bailing you. Know last minute.

**20:28:25**
And so I and I went and I wound up connecting with the CEO of this company was a they sponsored it. And so he had a presentation, and I just happened to be next to him. I think it was in line, like, you know, for the lunch to get, you know, grabbing lunch. And so we started talking. What do you do, blah, blah.

**20:28:44**
This is where, like, having the focus really helped. I think I do AI training for go to market teams.

**20:28:50**
And he was like, you know, immediately like, oh, you know, we should talk, and blah, blah, blah.

**20:28:56**
Had a conversation with him.

**20:28:59**
And I think maybe even in that conversation, I was like, you know, I do training, and it's normally works like this.

**20:29:05**
But I'd be happy to do a free, you know, like, 60 minute lunch and learn with whoever you want to invite and.

**20:29:15**
That resulted in paying work. And I know from the way that they were talking yesterday that it's going to result in ongoing work. Right? I'm going to basically become in some way their AI consultant.

**20:29:29**
Like Sherpa or something like they use.

**20:29:30**
Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly.

**20:29:33**
So I think that can be a really good way to do it because it, it breaks the, it breaks the. The biggest thing, especially I think, with AI and education on this. Like, there's so many charlatans, right? And so it break. There's. With hiring anyone. It's the trust issue, right? How do I know I can trust you.

**20:29:57**
And it puts you in front of them in a way that's like, oh, okay, like, this guy is for real, right? Or he's not right, and it forces you to perform as well.

**20:30:08**
And I mean, he never. He never asked me if. They never asked me for references. They never asked me for, like, you know, have you ever done this for anybody else? It was just like, you know, I demonstrated that I could effectively, you know, I guess I did a good enough job. And then lunch and learn is, is that. Point. And, you know, you do that for. You know, I could see that working for, you know, you may get a lot of people that just like, hey, like, can you do this again? I want to tell my friends who are other staffers to do it.

**20:30:33**
But you may, you know, depending on how often you do it and how many people show up, you could say you could get, you know, one person goes back and tells.

**20:30:43**
Their. I don't know what their team about it. And they're like, yeah, we should, you know, we should bring them in, right? And now maybe it takes a free lunch and learn with that group, you know, to, to break that barrier or something, but it might not be, like, immediately, oh, let's pay him. To bring him in, but I think. I think putting free stuff out there is a good way to do that. I also think the. The other thing that helped me.

**20:31:11**
And it has helped me in previous sort of iterations of.

**20:31:16**
Business.

**20:31:19**
Is just having an offering out there, right? Like, I don't know if you have a website, you know, that says, you know, like, what you do, you know, has some offering on it with some price, right? So you can just be like, this is what it is, this is what it costs.

**20:31:35**
What you do, what you choose to do after that is your call based on the scenario. Right. But at least it sort of put something out there in the world where they're like, oh, okay, right. Like, that's 3,500 bucks. Got it. Right. Or $199 for individuals or whatever it is. I think it's very helpful to give somebody just like, all right, like it's concrete. It's. You know, this is what it. It's a real thing that people can respond to and others say no or yes to.

**20:32:05**
I do have a website, but right now it's not payable or anything like that. It is like a few online modules and like a place where you can click to like schedule a consultation, but it just like an initial free one.

**20:32:16**
And all the pricing is just sort of made up, I guess, or determined based on the client.

**20:32:17**
Right.

**20:32:21**
Sure. Sure. Yeah. And you're focused on. It seems like you're focused on, like, online delivery, like. Like, you know, on demand stuff, not live training.

**20:32:31**
Yeah.

**20:32:32**
Or they have been.

**20:32:33**
My. My original focus was definitely online training. Asynchronous stuff.

**20:32:38**
And I had originally intended for a lot of it to be like, AI, integrated things like you're using AI to learn AI and stuff like that.

**20:32:44**
But I think part of my concern with that is that the chatbot are getting good enough that you might not need sort of much handle. You just ask for it to do the thing, and then I kind of just goes and runs off and does the thing for you.

**20:32:55**
Yeah.

**20:32:56**
That's where I think the quad code stuff, I think, is a bit more helpful. And even like cloud co work, when that gets more firmly established, they're not as intuitive to pick up, I think.

**20:33:05**
Y.

**20:33:07**
Eah.

**20:33:07**
So there's more room for trainings to be kind of a lead.

**20:33:10**
Yep. Yeah, I used to. There's. And. And you probably heard this, you know, like, whatever it was nine months ago, there was lots of people saying, just use AI to learn it, right?

**20:33:20**
Yeah.

**20:33:20**
And I think at that point there was some truth to that, like you could get really far. But I think we've progressed in that six to nine months, to a point where not only the tools are getting advanced enough, and I'm not even.

**20:33:35**
Thinking about Claude Code. Right. You know, but just the standard chatbots.

**20:33:40**
The tools are getting advanced enough with features and things like that, and also the techniques that we've all learned and developed.

**20:33:48**
Are getting numerous and advanced enough, just like. All right. No, you really do need some training to get the most out of these, right? You know, like, you can only get yourself so far with just banging away on your keyboard with, you know, in a chat bot.

**20:34:03**
Yeah, that is true.

**20:34:06**
I don't know.

**20:34:09**
I guess part of. Part of me wonders, like, how much Runway I should give this because I am living off, like, by savings and stuff like that.

**20:34:18**
And like you were saying, there's a lot of companies that are trying to do some of this, like AI dev work internally that could be possible to work on. Like my, my, my background, I guess I should just emphasize that more is more of a pure AI background. I did machine learning for science stuff when I was in grad school, like in the 2014, 2019 timeframe.

**20:34:35**
And then when I was at the the DOT contractor, I was essentially doing studies, like data science type studies.

**20:34:42**
For the department.

**20:34:42**
So that was always kind of my background. It's more firmly on the technological side.

**20:34:47**
But then, like you were saying, I kind of was good at translating, like, the government context or to, like the science context or to, like, the program management context, I guess, at nsf.

**20:34:57**
So part of me wonders if I should just go back and do that kind of stuff and try this on the side, or if that would, like, mean I would just never get it off the ground at all.

**20:35:06**
I don't know.

**20:35:07**
Yeah. No, I mean, it's a question that I've been in before.

**20:35:13**
And I mean, it all depends on, of course, your. Your financial situation and your, you know, how much Runway you have and, you know, what you. How, how. I mean, basically how hard you're willing to work to push it.

**20:35:26**
I think there's some.

**20:35:27**
And these are just. I'm gonna. This is my, like.

**20:35:31**
So I'm an entrepreneurial brain, right? And so I'm gonna give you ideas. I'm not giving them to you as advice. They're just pure ideas. Right. Or just like this may or may not connect with you. And, I mean, I've already been. Been doing that, so but one thought with that additional context is. And and again, you may have already also tried or thought of or, you know, dismissed any of these, but.

**20:35:58**
There could be an interesting niche. So one thing is I think you can lean on and I score. Haven't been to your website or anything like that, but I think you can lean on your, like, pure ML background, right?

**20:36:13**
I don't have anything like that.

**20:36:15**
To. To point to, Right? You know, I just have, you know, basically applied AI usage over the past two years, right?

**20:36:22**
And so that's an interesting. Just sort of proof point, right? If someone's looking at you versus someone else.

**20:36:29**
And like, all right, am I going to bring this person on to hire you or to. Sorry. To train my team or pay $200 to this person? $200. This person. It's like, all right.

**20:36:39**
This guy has been in it for longer than average. Right. And has some real deep experience to draw from. So that's just a proof point. Right. People won't necessarily even know what you're. What you did, or even need to know what you did, but you see that in their background and, you know, wherever. You went to school or whatever, you know, that. That. That's something that you can rely on and I think can be something that can potentially set you apart.

**20:37:04**
And something that you can stand on, right? To give you some confidence in that world.

**20:37:11**
The side of it that I think could be interesting. I mean, one you already identified was the staffers. I never would have thought of that, that. That could be an interesting avenue.

**20:37:20**
Especially, you know, since if you have experience there,

**20:37:24**
But the thing that really made my ears.

**20:37:26**
Perk up was the data science side.

**20:37:30**
Now, the thing that I don't know. So, like, offering, like.

**20:37:35**
ML, AI training for data science. Or pick another. Like, I don't know a lot about that world, but, you know, like, I may be using the wrong terms and you may need to, you may know enough that you would slice and dice it differently. Now, the challenge that I can think of there is that these are already smart people.

**20:37:56**
That are, you know, maybe diving into cloud code themselves and our power users of the AI chat bots.

**20:38:03**
But I have to think, because again, like, I think everything works on a bell curve, right? No matter what the audience is, no matter what the. The thing is.

**20:38:13**
There's going to be this group, this huge group in the middle.

**20:38:17**
That is like, yeah, I've got this. My colleagues that are going crazy with it, you know, But I'm not in that group or whatever reason. Right. You know, I've been scared of it. I just haven't had time to. I've been wanting to. So, yeah, if you can. If you can. Fast forward me six months, then. That's great, because, I mean, there's a ton of those people.

**20:38:36**
I think there's. I mean, obviously a ton of application there. I mean, I was just so, Like a couple last week. So let me just look at. I want to see her title.

**20:38:46**
I, I put a quick post up to LinkedIn about like, hey, I've got some free passes at Claude code if anyone. I want to give these out to a non technical person, you know, so anybody that's interested in getting touch. And so this woman got in touch. What was her title? Her title was.

**20:39:05**
Think it was?

**20:39:15**
What did.

**20:39:16**
She say?

**20:39:24**
Oh, no, she's more policy. Sorry. I thought she was more data oriented. Sorry.

**20:39:30**
But anyway.

**20:39:32**
I think that's the kind of thing that again, like, if you just say AI training.

**20:39:39**
Even for if you just say, like, AI Draining for policy. Right. It's pretty generic.

**20:39:46**
But AI training for congressional staffers could be an interesting. You know, just put that in their head, you know, that it's like, oh, this is for me. You want somebody, you know, somebody to hear you say it or read something or read your LinkedIn, you know, little headline or whatever it is and see themselves in it and be like, okay.

**20:39:46**
Yeah.

**20:40:09**
I need to contact this guy, or I at least need to write this guy's name down. But the data, for some reason,

**20:40:16**
And again, do your own research. But the data science thing seems interesting to me.

**20:40:21**
I think you're onto something. I think what job titles of job titles? People who hold the top job title of data scientist are probably writing code, but there's a much bigger category, people who are doing data analysis, like policy researchers and things like that.

**20:40:33**
There you go.

**20:40:35**
Yep.

**20:40:35**
And then that's kind of my distinction. If they're not coding, they're often not aware of cloud code, or they need at least not using it very much.

**20:40:42**
Yep.

**20:40:43**
And it's an audience that again, like, you know, and this is where I go to.

**20:40:48**
Claude code is super powerful. I use it myself, but I'm a former programmer.

**20:40:52**
And I'm comfortable with the command line.

**20:40:55**
I think for there's a lot of people.

**20:40:58**
That can get a lot of value out of just the regular chatbots. Right? And they can get a lot of value much quicker with regular chatbots. And that analyst data, that policy analysts or analysts data analyst side.

**20:41:15**
Could be interesting in that realm.

**20:41:17**
I think you're right. I mean, you had mentioned earlier that you hadn't done much like, BG sales. And, I mean, I haven't really done anything here with B2B sales, but I'm aware of a lot of, like, ways the government could fund this sort of thing.

**20:41:28**
So I've applied for some stuff, like philanthropic funding. I applied for SBIR funding, and unfortunately, none of those have panned out, but.

**20:41:37**
This administration in particular, has a lot of, like, rhetoric and executive orders passed around workforce development related to AI and things like that.

**20:41:46**
And part of. I mean, this goes back to the Runway thing, I think I could probably hang on for another half a year or so. The question is, like, the opportunity cost, maybe doing something else.

**20:41:56**
My own sort of, like, I guess, security. But it's possible that there are, like, grant programs that will come online. And I know a fair amount of government people. That's like, one of my biggest networks are people in the DoD or V. Ow I guess, and other places in the government.

**20:42:13**
And certainly like they themselves, a lot of them are using data analysis. But I feel like there if I could just crack, like, who has the money to do workforce development because there's so much talk about it.

**20:42:23**
But who's, like, actually, you know, vetting vendors for that and, like, putting the money out.

**20:42:30**
That's the one thing that I'm, like, trying to get a better handle on. I've been trying to hit up some of the tours of commerce, like, both around here and then around in Phoenix, where I'm from.

**20:42:39**
And so far, I think I'm getting probably hit by just some kind of spam catch, you know, thing like with email cold emails.

**20:42:47**
But I feel like there. There must be some way to break into it. I'm going to start attending some of the Arlington county ones.

**20:42:54**
Economic Development Association. Maybe Alexandria as well.

**20:43:00**
But definitely, I feel like there's at least a few different, like, niches.

**20:43:04**
That should be possible.

**20:43:08**
Yeah, things are. And I think it's. I mean, and I don't know who controls the person, because I don't know. You know, like, obviously on a. On a government or municipal level, that's completely out of my depth. But if you're talking about, like, you know.

**20:43:22**
Privately funded or like, like.

**20:43:25**
Civic groups kind of thing.

**20:43:27**
That have their own money.

**20:43:30**
If it works anything like the corporate world, right? Like, I'm going in and like, individual departments, like, so I engaged initially with sales intel, with the CEO.

**20:43:43**
I was quickly passed off to the Chief Revenue Officer. Right. Which handles the whole GTM organization.

**20:43:50**
And I think that's where the bucket of money is going to come from for my training. It's going to be departmental, and it may be the case there where.

**20:44:05**
You're not trying to get some big contract, right? Just like, you know, you're just trying to get one department to do.

**20:44:12**
$2,500 training or, you know,

**20:44:15**
X dollars a month for ongoing, you know, whatever it is.

**20:44:21**
And, you know, that might be easier.

**20:44:23**
Than trying to convince somebody to, you know.

**20:44:26**
Spend a bunch of money.

**20:44:28**
Yeah.

**20:44:30**
That's one thing I've been uncertain about, too, is like, just trying to get like, a big corporate client and then sort of do it that way and charge more, because then I would throw less guilty about charging, I think, a sustainable amount.

**20:44:43**
Have you. Have you found that with your sort of, like, expected, I guess, client load, that it's going to be sustainable for you to do what you're doing?

**20:44:51**
Or do you think more work?

**20:44:53**
I mean, we'll see. I mean, where. What I have to do is what. What I can't do is just continually. Just sell one off. Training. Right. Because then you do it. It's a fair amount of work.

**20:45:05**
And then once it's over.

**20:45:07**
You got to turn around and sell more people, right? Like you just got just this constant.

**20:45:13**
Hamster wheel, and so that's got to be a part of something bigger.

**20:45:20**
And something that leads into an ongoing engagement.

**20:45:25**
Whether that's training or otherwise. So you know what I put to the sales intel people?

**20:45:31**
Was basically a three part proposal, which was initial training and then like double tracking that. You'd have some governance, I would help them with some initial standing up, some governance.

**20:45:46**
Right. So, you know, AI policies and things like that, just to do a quick sprint on that.

**20:45:52**
And then once those two sort of initial projects were over and each of those projects had project pricing, right? Like this much for the training, the structure for the government, government sprint. And then an ongoing monthly retainer that would be like, all right, you know, we only got you so far with those other efforts, right? So it's like we need these things. And I would be basically a. A standing member on their AI Council.

**20:46:21**
And I would help them with X, Y and Z. Ongoing skill development. You know, one hour, like, you know, skill session, like. Like re up skill session, you know, for new. New features and new tools and things like that. You know, I just put together a little package. It's like, all right, you know, you're going. To hire me for three months. You're not just going to hire me for this one thing that lasts three weeks.

**20:46:44**
And then hopefully that continues. Right? You know, there's. You know, you're. You're fine. Once you're in, you're finding ways to make yourself valuable.

**20:46:55**
So that you can find. Oh, okay. Now we're doing that, you know, because the retainer is really just.

**20:47:02**
Like, get some steady income, right? You know, that's like, you know, whatever. It might be two hours a week, four hours a week, whatever.

**20:47:09**
And.

**20:47:11**
That covers, like, a pretty limited set of things. So, like, you're in there and you're a part of the discussions. You're in the AI Council. You're, you know, you're training people, you're, you're doing this and that for them, but you're just hearing lots of. Things so that you be like, oh, well, you know what we can do? Like, this team should, like, have, you know, should. Should do this right? And. Oh, you. You bought, you know, glean. Well, let's do we need to do some glean training. We need to do not. We need to glean training per department. Right. You know, you just sort of come up with these where she's like, all right, this is what's going on, because I. I'm trusting that.

**20:47:50**
Once. Once. I'm into a company.

**20:47:55**
I will be a part of. But just even without me, AI Use will just grow.

**20:48:00**
Right? And so the needs. The needs along with it will grow.

**20:48:05**
That makes sense.

**20:48:06**
So that's my. That's my hope, but no, just doing straight up training.

**20:48:12**
Is. That's a hamster wheel. I do not want to get on.

**20:48:15**
Okay?

**20:48:16**
Yeah, I've noticed there's another guy in a government contracting Chad, Amman who does some training stuff, but I notice he's also like an AI agent. Like solutions architect. Like you build stuff in addition to training.

**20:48:26**
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not, like, I don't. I don't put myself out there as, like, an AI engineer because I'm not that technical, you know. Like, I've used innate in and things like that, you know, just to familiarize my sort of base familiarization. But I'm certainly. Not going to be the one to, like, go out and build confidently and say, like, oh, yeah, I can build that.

**20:48:45**
But I can certainly be the one that is, you know, helping to figure out, like, okay, well, what's the process, you know, towards something where you might want to hire somebody like a, like, like an engineer to do it? Right. So let's start with just having it in a project or starting in a GPT. Or a clutch skill or whatever, test it out, you know, and then, okay, well, now let's put it into relay or, you know, whatever. And then, like, you know, phase it out. And then once we get to this point, it's like, okay, well, now it's all completely specked out. We've sort of piloted it, you know, gotten it, you know, upgraded it here and there, and now, you know, it provides value. So, yeah, let's. Let's have a freelance AI engineer build it for $5,000 or whatever it is, right?

**20:49:33**
And then continue from there.

**20:49:36**
Yeah. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

**20:49:38**
I appreciate the candor. It's helpful.

**20:49:39**
Yeah. No, of course. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm all about.

**20:49:43**
And I appreciate. You know, I'm glad we got together.

**20:49:48**
And, yeah, we just stay connected. You got my. My phone number? Feel free to text me cool stuff if you got events.

**20:49:56**
Just something, a cool link. You're like, check this out. You know, feel free to just hit me up.

**20:50:00**
Yeah, definitely. I post a lot of stuff on LinkedIn, so that might be one way to see some of it.

**20:50:03**
Yeah, likewise.

**20:50:05**
Is there anything else I can directly do to help you?

**20:50:08**
No, just keep your ear to the, you know, ground for me, you know, and if you hear anybody like wilds, I'll do the same for you. But, you know, in your world,

**20:50:19**
And, you know, if you're anybody that's, you know.

**20:50:22**
Sales and marketing focused, but really like B to B tech firms, marketing agencies, you know, any. Anybody like that? You know, that's my history. That's where my experience lies. That's the kind of company. So, you know, if you're any of your friends that work in a company like that, like. Oh, yeah. You know?

**20:50:42**
So. So one of my co founders who had to drop out, she. She's from Richmond and she lives there now.

**20:50:47**
Okay? That's where I grew up.

**20:50:48**
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So you're probably very familiar with the marketing scene there. Like her, a lot of her family and friends work in the marketing scene there.

**20:50:55**
Okay? No, not at all. I've lived here since 1998, so, I mean, I have friends there, but. Yeah, I mean, I don't. My family is all moved out there, you know, since then.

**20:51:05**
Yeah. If there's any connections. And I'm happy to just have a talk because, like, I had this talk with this guy at ID me, you know, just to learn about, you know, what are they. What's. What's that person's particular company department doing, you know, where can they. And that can. Sometimes lead to something, but I'm not going into that call to do that. I go into the call sort of like this, where it's like I can. If I can help on the call, then I will. Right? I'll even, like, do a quick screen share and be like, oh, you're doing that. Here's you check out how you might be able to do that better or whatever, right?

**20:51:38**
Yeah. I'll introduce you to Connie, my. My friend.

**20:51:40**
Okay?

**20:51:41**
She could definitely connect to you, I think with some of her family and friends. You just tell her, like, hey, Nick said you should talk, or I'll say the introduction. And so you specialize in marketing and stuff?

**20:51:51**
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, feel free.

**20:51:54**
I'm giving you permission to make that intro, so. And you're fine to. Because I always do sort of double opt in intros, right? So I never like, hey, just meet this person. And then, because it's happened to me before and it's just like, I don't want to meet this. Person, you know?

**20:52:09**
Yeah, I always wait for the same thing.

**20:52:11**
Yeah. Yeah, so. But I appreciate it. And then I'll think about my world, too, and just keep my ears perked up.

**20:52:21**
Know, policy. Congressional. You know, things. Keep me posted on that data.

**20:52:24**
Yeah.

**20:52:27**
Data stuff would be. It's good too. If you know anyone who wants to build something, I'm also fine.

**20:52:32**
Branching out into building things for people, especially if they.

**20:52:34**
And when you say build something, like what technologies, you know, like, what do you. What do you know?

**20:52:42**
Like agents, essentially, I think.

**20:52:44**
So, like, but, like, from the ground up, like, you know, use it like python and, you know, from that level.

**20:52:50**
Yeah, I mean, I can code in Python, but I mean, just being honest with everyone, I use a AI coding tools.

**20:52:56**
Yeah.

**20:52:58**
Okay? Yeah, I just didn't know where you fit in and.

**20:53:01**
I can. Yeah, yeah.

**20:53:04**
Yeah. I mean, like, it would be silly not to, right?

**20:53:09**
Okay?

**20:53:10**
Yeah, let's stay in touch, man. This is. This is a good call. I'm glad we connected.

**20:53:14**
Yeah. Thanks, Nicholas.

**20:53:15**

**20:53:36**
I appreciate it.

**20:53:37**
Of course. I mean, that's how it works. So you gotta. I don't write. I've stopped writing for the algorithm. Like, I don't do hooks anymore. I write in multi sentence paragraphs, you know, like, I don't do that, you know, like that whole, like, you know, what do they call? It bro a tree LinkedIn broetry but I will game it by getting people to like my posts or or like like other people.

**20:54:01**
Old fashioned engagement farming.

**20:54:03**
Exactly. Exactly.

**20:54:05**
All right, man. We'll be in touch.
