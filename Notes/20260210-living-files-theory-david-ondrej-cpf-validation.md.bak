## The "Living Files" Theory

**Dead file:** Any file that sits in a folder doing nothing unless a human manually opens it.

**Living file:** Markdown file accessible to AI agents 24/7, which can reference, update, modify, and act on it autonomously.

### Key Insights

- **The verbalization problem:** To create powerful living files, you must articulate your thinking clearly — preferences, judgment, goals, decision frameworks — into structured files. "If you cannot verbalize it, you cannot automate it."
- **Compounding returns:** Every hour building living files compounds. Each piece of context makes the agent permanently smarter — not just for one conversation, forever.
- **The gap:** Between generic AI use and context-rich AI use is ~100x and widening.
- **Personal scale:** One person with a well-built living file system outperforms a team of 10 still emailing PDFs.

## CPF Connection

This validates CPF's core premise from the personal productivity angle, but reveals the **bigger market opportunity:**

- **The verbalization problem IS CPF's problem:** Most organizations can't articulate their own context clearly. They need a framework/process.
- **CPF profiles ARE living files:** Structured, AI-accessible context that compounds over time.
- **Why CPF > DIY markdown:** Individuals can write their own "live files" in markdown. Organizations can't. They need:
  - Research methodology (CPF research pipeline)
  - Verification layer (catches gaps, incomplete research)
  - Ongoing maintenance (profiles get stale)
  - Integration with decision-making workflows

The hard problem isn't the file format — it's getting organizations to DO the verbalization work at scale. That's CPF's opportunity.

## Why Saved

Reinforces CPF positioning: living files for individuals are possible; living files for organizations require expertise and process. That's the moat.
