I don't care that you used AI to write. I really don't.

I do care that you don't have a perspective, so your writing is boring and uninsightful.

I do care that you call yourself an AI expert, but your writing makes it obvious you don't know how to use AI to match your style. (Or you're just lazy, which is worse.)
