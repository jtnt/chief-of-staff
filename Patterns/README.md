# Patterns

Cross-project insights extracted from session logs and check-ins. These are reusable frameworks, validated approaches, and recurring themes that compound across your work.

## Purpose

Most session logs capture *what happened*. This folder captures *what we learned* that applies beyond a single project or session.

## Types of Patterns

### Messaging Patterns
How to communicate value, position offerings, craft problem statements
- StoryBrand applications
- Sales communication approaches
- What resonates vs. what falls flat

### Technical Patterns
Architectural decisions, implementation approaches, tool choices
- When to use X vs. Y
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Process Patterns
Workflows, methodologies, approaches that work
- How we validated an assumption
- Sprint structures that worked
- Meeting formats that produced results

### Decision Frameworks
Reusable reasoning for common decision types
- Competitive positioning analysis approach
- Feature prioritization criteria
- When to build vs. buy

## How Patterns Get Here

1. **Manual extraction:** When a session log has an insight worth preserving, add it here
2. **Weekly synthesis:** `/review-checkins` can extract patterns from recent logs
3. **Pattern recognition:** When you notice the same insight in multiple places, consolidate here
