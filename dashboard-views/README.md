# Dashboard Views

This directory contains synthesized content generated by agents for dashboard consumption.

## Files

- `daily-brief.md` - Generated by daily-briefer agent each morning
- `projects-overview.md` - Generated by pattern-detector agent (cross-project analysis)
- `activity-feed.md` - Generated by activity-synthesizer agent (human-readable timeline)
- `projects/` - Individual project summaries generated by project-analyzer agent

## How It Works

1. Agents trigger during workflows (/morning, /save) or on demand
2. Agents read raw files (logs, project-knowledge.md, calendar)
3. Agents synthesize intelligence and write structured markdown here
4. Dashboard reads these files and renders them beautifully

## Source of Truth

These files ARE the source of truth for the dashboard. The dashboard never parses raw logs - it only reads these pre-synthesized views.

## Freshness

Each file includes a "Last updated" timestamp. The dashboard shows staleness indicators when content is old.
