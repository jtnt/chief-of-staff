# Today: Saturday, January 25, 2026

*Last updated: 7:15 PM PST*

## Next Up
No meetings scheduled for tomorrow (Sunday).

## Focus Recommendation
**Complete the dashboard implementation and test the agent workflows.** The Chief of Staff Dashboard v2 has been built but agents haven't been tested yet. Run `/morning` to generate a fresh daily brief using the daily-briefer agent.

## Needs Attention
- **Dashboard v2**: Just built, needs testing
- **Agent integration**: Commands updated but agents not yet triggered

*These will be populated with real data once agents run.*
