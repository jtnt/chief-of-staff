## Strategic Insights

### Effort vs Priorities
Heavy investment in Chief of Staff (meta-work) this week. This is intentional - building the system to support future work. After dashboard completion, shift focus back to Razzo and CPF deliverables.

### Consolidation Opportunities
CPF and Razzo share themes around AI capabilities. Consider whether Razzo's "AI training" positioning could explicitly reference CPF methodology.

### Recommendations
1. **Complete CoS dashboard:** Finish current meta-work sprint, then shift focus
2. **Razzo client outreach:** No client activity in 7 days - re-engage
3. **CPF MVP decision:** The "define MVP" item has been open too long - make a decision
