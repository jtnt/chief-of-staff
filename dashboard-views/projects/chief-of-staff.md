**Active - System Building** | Last activity: Today | Momentum: 🟢

## Needs Attention
All items are current.

## Suggested Next Action
**Test the dashboard and agent workflows.** The dashboard v2 is built - now verify it works by running `/morning` to trigger the daily-briefer agent and checking if the dashboard updates correctly.

## Current Priorities
1. Test dashboard v2 with real data - just built
2. Verify agent triggers work - integrated with /morning and /save
3. Document the new system - update project-knowledge.md

## Open Items

| Document agents | 0 days | open | Four agents created today |
