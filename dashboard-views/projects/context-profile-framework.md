# Context Profile Framework

*Last updated: 7:15 PM PST*

## Status
**Active - R&D Phase** | Last activity: 2 days ago | Momentum: 🟡

## Needs Attention
- **Define MVP scope:** 14 days old - needs decision on general vs. domain approach
- **Pricing strategy:** 10 days old - connected to MVP decision

## Suggested Next Action
**Make the general vs. domain decision.** This is blocking MVP definition, pricing, and positioning. Spend 60 minutes thinking through the implications of each approach and make a call.

## Current Priorities
1. Define MVP scope - blocked on general vs. domain decision
2. Document four-layer architecture - in progress
3. Identify pilot candidates - waiting on MVP

## Open Items
| Item | Age | Status | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| General vs. domain approach | 14 days | blocked | Fundamental architecture question |
| Define MVP | 14 days | blocked | Waiting on above |
| Pricing model | 10 days | open | Needs market research |
| Holy shit moment | 7 days | open | Need to define the aha experience |

## Cross-Project Connections
