# Chief of Staff: Boris Cherny Claude Code Tips

## What Was Done

**Captured Boris Cherny's 10 Claude Code tips from Twitter thread** (8MB transcript, 144 total messages). Used browser automation to navigate to the Twitter thread, expand all "Show more" sections, and systematically capture each tip with screenshots and detailed transcription.

**Complete 10-tip breakdown extracted:**
1. **Parallel worktrees** - Run 3-5 git worktrees simultaneously with shell aliases
2. **Plan mode discipline** - Start complex tasks in plan mode, use second Claude as reviewer
3. **CLAUDE.md investment** - Update after every correction, maintain notes directories
4. **Custom skills creation** - Turn daily tasks into skills, commit to git
5. **Autonomous bug fixing** - Trust Claude with "just fix" approach
6. **Advanced prompting** - Challenge Claude, demand elegant solutions, write detailed specs
7. **Terminal optimization** - Ghostty, /statusline, tmux, voice dictation (fn fn)
8. **Subagent utilization** - Offload tasks, keep main context clean, permission routing
9. **Data analytics** - Use Claude with database CLIs for on-fly analysis
10. **Learning systems** - Explanatory mode, HTML presentations, spaced-repetition skills

**Saved comprehensive guide** to [[Resources/Claude Code/20260131-boris-cherny-10-claude-code-tips.md]] with specific applicability analysis for current workflow and immediate action items.

## Key Decisions

**Prioritized immediate wins** from the 10 tips:
1. Voice dictation (fn fn) for longer prompts
2. "Scrap this and implement elegant solution" prompt pattern
3. Post-correction CLAUDE.md updates as routine habit

**Storage location:** Placed in existing [[Resources/Claude]] Code/ directory structure rather than creating new folder.

## Reasoning

**Why this capture was valuable:**
- **Insider knowledge:** Tips come from Claude Code team members with production experience
- **Concrete techniques:** Specific command patterns, workflow optimizations, and automation ideas
- **Immediate applicability:** Several tips can be implemented today (voice dictation, prompting patterns)
- **Strategic insights:** Multi-session workflows, subagent patterns, learning systems

**Pattern to remember:** Browser automation for comprehensive content capture works well for Twitter threads - systematically expand all sections before capturing rather than trying to piece together from collapsed state.

## Changes Made

**Files created:**
- [[Resources/Claude Code/20260131-boris-cherny-10-claude-code-tips.md]] - Complete analysis with 10 tips, applicability assessment, and action items

**Files modified:**
- `cos-inbox.md` - Added reminder about quick-win action items for next session

**Git verification shows:** Two changes match transcript analysis - new resource file and inbox update.

## Open Items

**Immediate implementation opportunities:**
1. Try voice dictation (fn fn) for next complex prompt
2. Use "scrap and implement elegant solution" when Claude output feels clunky
3. Build spaced-repetition learning skill for technical concepts
4. Consider permission routing hook for auto-approving safe requests
5. Experiment with second Claude session as plan reviewer

**Research areas:**
- Ghostty terminal setup and /statusline customization
- Context dump skill that aggregates calendar/Notion/email
- Analytics integration with project metrics

None require immediate action - captured for future exploration.
