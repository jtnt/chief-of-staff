# Chief of Staff: Agent Edits Quick Exit

## What Was Done

Trivial session. User ran `/agents` local command which:
- Created agent: `verbal-identity-builder`
- Updated agent: `cpf-company-researcher` (opened in editor twice)

Then ran `/exit quick` immediately. No assistant messages exchanged.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files modified in the CoS repo. Agent changes were made via Claude Code's `/agents` command (edits to agent definition files outside this repo).

## Open Items

None identified.
