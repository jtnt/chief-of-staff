# Chief of Staff: Insights Report Location

## What Was Done

User asked where `/insights` command output is saved. After initial confusion about which command (extract-insights skill vs built-in /insights), clarified that `/insights` is a built-in Claude Code command that generates usage reports. Output is saved to:

- **HTML report:** `~/.claude/usage-data/report.html`
- **Facets data:** `~/.claude/usage-data/facets/`

User ran `/insights` twice during the session, generating fresh reports both times. The command analyzes all Claude Code sessions and produces comprehensive usage analytics including project areas, interaction patterns, friction analysis, and suggestions.

## Key Decisions

No decisions made.

## Reasoning

Routine informational session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files were modified. The Dashboard files show as modified in git status, but these are uncommitted changes from a previous session, not from this one. This session was purely conversational.

## Open Items

None identified.
