# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-25 11:01 AM EST

## Summary
Reviewed and organized references for future session-saving system improvements. Identified two external projects (conversation-logger and cc-sessions) as potential inspiration for enhancing the current session capture workflow. Moved reference documentation to the appropriate Resources folder.

## Key Points
- Saved two repository references for session-saving system evaluation:
  - `sirkitree/conversation-logger` with explanation article
  - `GWUDCAP/cc-sessions`
- Clarified these are inspiration sources, not directives for implementation
- Created `Resources/Claude Code/session-saving-references.md` with links and context
- Updated `project-knowledge.md` with reference to saved documentation
- Corrected file organization (moved from logs to Resources where it belongs)

## Open Items
- Review and evaluate session-saving alternatives when revisiting the system design
- Consider applicability of referenced approaches to current auto-capture, /save, /log, /evening workflow
