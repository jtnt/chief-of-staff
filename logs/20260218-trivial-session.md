# Chief of Staff: Trivial Session

Trivial session - nothing to capture.

User installed the `image-generator` plugin from the `dair-academy-plugins` marketplace and asked a quick factual question about how `export` works in bash (answer: in-memory only, lasts for current terminal session, not persisted to disk unless added to shell profile).

No project work, no files modified.
