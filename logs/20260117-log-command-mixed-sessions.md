# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-17 08:51 AM EST
**Session Type:** meta-work

## What Was Done

Added documentation guidance to the `/log` command for handling mixed-work sessions. The update explains that when a session covers multiple unrelated topics, the log file should be named after the primary/largest piece of work, with all topics captured in the file content.

## Key Decisions

- **Primary topic naming approach**: Decided that mixed-work sessions should use the main topic for the filename rather than trying to combine all topics or creating multiple log files. The sections inside the log organize different work items.

## Changes Made

- Edited `~/.claude/commands/log.md` - Added guidance paragraph in Step 3 explaining how to name logs for mixed-work sessions

## Open Items

None identified.
