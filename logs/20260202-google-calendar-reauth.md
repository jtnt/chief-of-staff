# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

User requested calendar check. During the process, discovered that Google Calendar MCP server authentication tokens had expired and both accounts needed re-authentication.

Successfully re-authenticated both Google Calendar accounts through the MCP server:
- Primary account: jtntolson@gmail.com (added via manage-accounts)
- Razzo account: nicholas@razzohq.com (added via manage-accounts)

The session was interrupted before calendar events were retrieved, but authentication is now restored and calendar access should work in future sessions.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions - routine authentication workflow.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files were modified during this session. This was purely an authentication/configuration session for the Google Calendar MCP server.

## Open Items

None identified - authentication completed successfully.
