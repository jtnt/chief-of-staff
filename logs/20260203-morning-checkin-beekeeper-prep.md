# Chief of Staff: Morning Checkin Beekeeper Prep

## What Was Done

**Morning check-in executed** with user sharing day intentions: Beekeeper Group meeting at 3pm, Air Hops homework, LinkedIn video idea about Google Docs sync, and I-Corps mentor application work.

**Comprehensive client research and meeting preparation** for Beekeeper Group:
- Created new client folder structure: `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Beekeeper Group/`
- Researched Beekeeper Group: DC advocacy agency with 4-person leadership team (Shana Brown partner, Alexandra Liccione VP Technology, plus Landin and Mike)
- Deep-dive analysis of AdvocacyAI platform and their Level 1-2-3 AI adoption framework
- Identified strategic positioning: user's training fills the gap between AdvocacyAI's "bare minimum" Level 1 and the sophisticated Level 2/3 that requires centralized data and technical implementation
- Created comprehensive meeting prep document with multiple pitch scenarios based on whether Beekeeper wants internal training, client delivery partnership, or both

**Strategic insights developed:**
- AdvocacyAI's own framework validates user's position - they call Level 1 "bare minimum" but don't teach it
- Significant gap exists between Level 1 (basic prompting) and Level 2 (predictive modeling/propensity scoring)
- Agency model creates multiple engagement opportunities: internal team training, client delivery partnership, or hybrid approach

## Key Decisions

**Client organization:** Established Clients folder at `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/` as shared resource across all projects, not nested under specific projects.

**Meeting strategy:** Positioned training as complementary to, not competitive with, AdvocacyAI platform. Framework: "You can't skip levels" - organizations need Level 1 foundation before Level 2/3 platforms deliver value.

**Research depth:** Chose comprehensive preparation over surface-level research given seniority of attendees (partner + VP + 2 others) and potential scope of engagement.

## Reasoning

**Why comprehensive prep matters:** Four-person senior team meeting signals serious evaluation, not casual conversation. User's comment about AdvocacyAI ("typically stay away from point solutions") and contact's response ("We shall discuss!") indicates this will be a substantive strategy discussion requiring informed perspectives.

**Why positioning matters:** Rather than arguing against platforms like AdvocacyAI, user can position training as essential foundation. AdvocacyAI's own documentation supports this - they assume Level 1 competency but don't teach it, and Level 2+ requires "unified, centralized data" most organizations lack.

**Agency model insight:** Beekeeper serves clients who do actual advocacy work. This creates multiple value propositions: train Beekeeper staff to better advise clients, become delivery partner for client training, or both. Each requires different approach and pricing.

## Execution Plan

**Meeting preparation (by 3pm):**
1. Review comprehensive prep doc at `Clients/Beekeeper Group/20260203-meeting-prep.md`
2. Key talking points: ASCO case study (doubled PAC contributions using basic AI), Level 1-2-3 framework positioning, three engagement models
3. Strategic questions prepared to determine internal vs client focus

**Adaptive pitch ready:**
- **If internal focus:** AI Workflow Sprint for Beekeeper team to enhance client advisory capabilities
- **If client delivery:** Partnership model where user delivers training to Beekeeper's clients
- **If hybrid:** Phased approach starting internal then expanding to client services

**Follow-up framework:** Prep doc includes post-meeting capture template for next steps based on their interests and decision-making timeline.

## Changes Made

**Files created:**
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Beekeeper Group/` (new directory)
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Beekeeper Group/20260203-meeting-prep.md` (comprehensive preparation document)
- [[Check-Ins/daily/20260203-morning.md]] (morning check-in record)

**Research artifacts:**
- Beekeeper Group company analysis with leadership team mapping
- AdvocacyAI platform analysis with detailed Level 1-2-3 framework breakdown
- Strategic positioning document with multiple engagement scenarios

## Open Items

**Immediate (by 3pm):** Review prep document before Beekeeper meeting

**Post-meeting:** Capture meeting outcomes, update opportunity status, determine next steps based on their interests

**Secondary priorities for today:** Air Hops homework completion, LinkedIn video recording about Google Docs sync feature, I-Corps mentor application work (time permitting)

**Strategic question for user:** LinkedIn video aligns with building AI strategist brand but user previously noted "over-indexing on content vs. outreach" - need to balance content creation with targeted business development activities
