# Chief of Staff: Razzo LinkedIn Headline Brainstorm

## What Was Done

Attempted to update the Razzo LinkedIn headline from "AI Training for Sales & Marketing Teams" to better reflect the new engagement model (Advisory + Sprint + Bootcamp). Read [[../razzo/project-knowledge.md]] to get context on the model shift.

Generated multiple headline options across styles:
- Embedded AI Advisory for Sales & Marketing Teams
- AI Advisory for Sales & Marketing Teams
- AI Consultant for Sales & Marketing Teams (briefly selected, then rejected)
- AI Workflow Consultant for Sales & Marketing Teams
- "I Help Sales & Marketing Teams Build AI Workflows, Not Just Learn AI"
- Helping Revenue Teams Turn AI Experiments Into Shared Workflows

User rejected all options as either too generic ("AI Consultant for Sales & Marketing Teams") or too buzzword-y. Session ended without a final headline decision.

The core tension: generic/searchable titles don't differentiate; specific/differentiated titles require the user to articulate what actually makes Razzo different. The session ended with that question open — "what's one thing a client has said to you, or a result you've seen?"

## Key Decisions

No decisions finalized. User rejected all proposed headlines.

## Reasoning

- "Embedded" was rejected for being inside-baseball jargon that won't land on cold scroll
- "Advisory" was rejected as weird/unclear to prospects
- "AI Consultant" was rejected as too generic (correct — it describes ~10,000 LinkedIn profiles)
- The real differentiator is the *workflow implementation* angle, not training/consulting/advisory labels
- **Pattern to remember:** LinkedIn headline brainstorming needs a concrete client result or outcome to anchor on. Without that anchor, all options feel generic. Start there next time.

## Changes Made

No files modified. Read-only session.

## Open Items

- LinkedIn headline is still unresolved — still shows "AI Training for Sales & Marketing Teams"
- Need a concrete client result or testimonial quote to anchor the headline on the actual differentiator (workflow implementation, not just training)
- Next attempt: start by asking "what's a specific result a client saw?" before generating options
