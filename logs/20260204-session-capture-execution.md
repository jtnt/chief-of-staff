# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

**Executed session-capture workflow** - processed the transcript of a Chief of Staff session that included morning briefing, fan issue investigation, and MCP cleanup. Discovered the session had already been captured mid-session (20260204-runaway-mcp-cleanup.md), creating a complete log of the MCP process investigation and CLAUDE.md update.

**Verified previous capture completeness** - reviewed the existing log and patterns files. The earlier capture fully documented the key work: diagnosing runaway notebooklm-mcp processes (22 instances, 400% CPU), cleaning them up, removing NotebookLM MCP server, and adding "Investigate, Don't Speculate" principle to global CLAUDE.md.

**Identified session structure** - this was a 104 assistant message, 84 user message session spanning 5+ hours. Started with briefing, moved through normal CoS work, then shifted to system troubleshooting when user reported fan issues.

## Key Decisions

**No duplicate logging needed** - since the substantive work was already captured mid-session with complete detail, this end-of-session capture serves primarily as verification and process completion.

## Reasoning

**Mid-session capture worked well** - the earlier capture happened right after the investigation/cleanup work, preserving the diagnostic process and findings while they were fresh. This demonstrates the value of immediate capture for significant work rather than waiting for session end.

**Session-capture as verification** - even when work is already logged, the end-of-session process provides quality assurance and ensures nothing was missed.

## Changes Made

**This session log created** - documents the session-capture execution itself.

Cross-reference git shows the commit was already made:
```
38c3f393 Auto-capture: Runaway MCP cleanup and investigation principle

```

## Open Items

None identified - session was fully captured earlier in the workflow.
