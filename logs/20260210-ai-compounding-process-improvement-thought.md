# Chief of Staff: AI Compounding Process Improvement Thought

## What Was Done

Captured a new writing idea about how AI enables compounding process improvements. The user was working on a proposal (version 8, with dozens of revisions) and realized that with AI, the workflow should include a retrospective step: have AI analyze the entire revision history to extract patterns and codify improvements for future proposals.

Created new draft at [[../writing/Drafts/20260210_ai-compounding-process-improvement/post.md]] capturing two key layers:
1. **The retrospective loop** — After completing work, use AI to analyze the full process and extract how to improve next time (not just save the final output as an example)
2. **The "why behind the what"** — Capturing the process and thinking behind decisions is where the real compounding value lives, not just the final artifact

Also searched for and found a thematically related draft from yesterday ([[../writing/Drafts/20260209_ai-intensifies-work-linkedin/post.md]]) about HBR research showing AI intensifies work rather than reducing it. The new thought is a potential answer to that problem — if work intensifies, the counter is to use AI to compound process improvements so each iteration starts from a higher baseline.

## Key Decisions

**Created new draft rather than adding to yesterday's post** — The existing post is about the organizational problem (work expands, boundaries blur), while this thought is about the individual mindset shift. They're related but different arguments that should stand separately.

## Reasoning

Routine thought capture session following natural workflow: search for existing drafts, determine relationship, create new draft with clear structure. The connection to yesterday's AI-intensifies-work post emerged naturally but they address different aspects of the same broader topic.

## Changes Made

**New files created:**
- [[../writing/Drafts/20260210_ai-compounding-process-improvement/post.md]] — New draft capturing the compounding process improvement idea

**Files read for context:**
- [[../writing/Drafts/20260209_ai-intensifies-work-linkedin/post.md]]
- [[../writing/research/20260209_ai-intensifies-work-hbr-ranganathan-ye/analysis.md]]

**Git status shows:**
- `M project-knowledge.md` (modified, not committed yet from previous session)
