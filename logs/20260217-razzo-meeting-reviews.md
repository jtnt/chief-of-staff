# Chief of Staff: Razzo Meeting Reviews

## What Was Done

Processed two Razzo networking calls from 2026-02-16 via `/meeting-review` skill using Granola transcripts. Both meetings were processed in parallel, summaries written to the Razzo project, and follow-ups routed to Razzo's task list.

**Meeting 1: Nicholas & Pat Intro (with Patrick Schaber)**
- First intro call with Patrick Schaber, Minneapolis-based AI consultant on a parallel path to Nicholas
- Strong mutual fit: similar positioning, similar ICP challenges, shared interest in LinkedIn video strategy
- Pat's LinkedIn video approach: screen recordings, Tue/Thu cadence, first video got 28 likes / 33 comments
- Discussed Tella vs. Descript for video production workflow
- Pat proposed an invite-only Slack community for trusted AI practitioners
- Pat's Make.com story involved a vendor pricing/security detail — redacted per third-party privacy rules
- 6 follow-ups routed to Razzo tasks
- Summary: `Razzo/Meetings/20260216-nicholas-pat-intro/20260216-nicholas-pat-intro.md`

**Meeting 2: Nicholas Tolson and Jared Schulman (Ottermatic Systems)**
- Peer networking call comparing ICP refinement challenges and engagement models
- Jared's observation: solopreneurs self-serve — confirms Razzo's 50-500 person sweet spot
- Nicholas shared the Fractional Chief AI Officer structure as potential repeatability solution
- Jared has an HR consultant contact worth connecting with (double opt-in)
- 3 follow-ups routed to Razzo tasks
- Summary: `Razzo/Meetings/20260216-nicholas-tolson-jared-schulman/20260216-nicholas-tolson-jared-schulman.md`

- `Razzo/project-knowledge.md` — 9 new task items added (6 from Pat intro + 3 from Jared call)
