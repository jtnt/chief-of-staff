# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-23 07:34 AM EST
**Session Type:** project-work

## What Was Done

Saved a LinkedIn post about building a Chrome extension for AI chatbots. The extension changes Return key behavior (Return = line break, Shift+Return = submit) to prevent premature submissions.

Initially saved to wrong location (Check-Ins/thoughts/), then corrected to proper structure in `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Writing/Published/20260123_chrome-extension-vibe-coding/` with:
- `chrome-extension-vibe-coding.md` - post content
- `return-key-line-breaks-request.png` - screenshot of LinkedIn posts that sparked the idea

## Key Decisions

- Post is published content, belongs in Writing/Published/ not Check-Ins/thoughts/
- Use descriptive filenames (not generic like "post.md" or "linkedin-posts.png")
- Follow established naming convention: folder uses date_slug format, markdown file uses slug.md

## Changes Made
