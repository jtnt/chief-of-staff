# Chief of Staff: Eric AI Education Meeting Review

## What Was Done

Ran `/meeting-review` to process the 2026-02-18 conversation between Nicholas and Eric about AI education. The session was initiated from CoS but output routed to Razzo project.

**Source materials:**
- Granola recording: "Nicholas + Eric / AI Education Chat" (document ID `b2ffb602-790b-47fb-9255-a6c4d4f1f2b0`)
- User-provided Gemini transcript: `Nicholas + Eric _ AI Education Chat - 2026_02_18 10_44 EST - Notes and Transcript by Gemini.md`

**Meeting context:** Eric manages a licensed AI platform for ~100 colleges and is building his own AI writing tool. This was a peer-level conversation, not a prospect conversation. Key topics: AI upskilling, curriculum partnership, access to Eric's higher-ed network.

**Output generated:** `[[../razzo/Meetings/20260218-nicholas-eric-ai-education-chat/20260218-nicholas-eric-ai-education-chat-summary.md]]`

**Follow-ups routed to Razzo project-knowledge.md Tasks (4 items):**
1. Send Eric Trust Steam / Trust Tech info and offer introduction
2. Follow up with Eric after he talks with Annie — schedule free lunch-and-learn for brick-and-mortar team
3. Eric to talk with Annie re: AI upskilling engagement (watch for response)
4. Eric to probe opportunities to intro Nicholas into higher-ed partner network (~2 weeks)

## Key Decisions

- Routed meeting to Razzo project (correct — Eric is a potential Razzo partner)
- Framing corrected during session: the recap initially used "prospect" language, but Eric is better described as a peer/partner — he has his own platform and distribution. The summary itself already reflected this correctly.

## Reasoning

- **Partnership vs. prospect framing matters:** Eric manages licensed AI for 100 colleges and is building his own writing tool. Treating him as a prospect would be the wrong foot. The lunch-and-learn for Annie's team is the immediate play; the higher-ed network access is the longer game.
- **Immediate action vs. longer play:** Two different timelines emerged — near-term (lunch-and-learn) and medium-term (curriculum partnership / network access). Follow-ups were structured around both.

## Changes Made

Meeting summary and materials created in Razzo project:
- `[[../razzo/Meetings/20260218-nicholas-eric-ai-education-chat/20260218-nicholas-eric-ai-education-chat-summary.md]]` — full meeting summary
- Follow-up tasks added to Razzo `project-knowledge.md`

No CoS files were modified. Tracking file updated (`~/.claude/data/processed-meetings.json`).

```bash
git status --short  # clean
```

Git confirmed no uncommitted changes in CoS at time of capture.

## Open Items

- Watch for Eric's response after talking with Annie
- Eric to probe higher-ed partner network intro opportunities (~2 weeks out)
- Confirm whether Trust Steam / Trust Tech intro was sent
