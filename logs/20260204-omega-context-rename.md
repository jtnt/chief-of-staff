# Chief of Staff: Ω_context to z_context Rename Session

## What Was Done

**Comprehensive folder and reference rename across project ecosystem:**
- Renamed context folders from `Ω_context` to `z_context` for easier typing and system compatibility
- Updated 13 files with references across 6 projects
- Performed git-tracked folder rename in Razzo repository
- Committed and pushed changes to tracked repositories

**Specific changes made:**
- **Folder renames**: `Razzo/Ω_context/` → `Razzo/z_context/` (git mv)
- **File updates**: 13 files across Razzo, Beekeeper Group, Mythos-More Vang, SalesIntel, Party Rental, and Chief of Staff
- **CLAUDE.md updates**: 5 project CLAUDE.md files updated with new folder references
- **Log file updates**: 4 Chief of Staff historical logs updated for consistency

**Repository commits:**
- Razzo: Committed folder rename + CLAUDE.md update, pushed to remote
- Chief of Staff: Committed 4 log file updates, pushed to remote
- Client folders: Updated but not git-tracked (standalone files)

## Key Decisions

**Standardization choice**: Selected `z_context` over alternatives because:
- Easier to type than Ω symbol
- Alphabetically sorts to end (like Ω intended)
- Avoids special character compatibility issues
- Maintains recognizable context meaning

**Update scope**: Updated all historical references in logs and documentation rather than just going-forward references to maintain consistency and searchability across the entire project ecosystem.

## Reasoning

**Why comprehensive update over selective**: Updated all historical references because:
- **Searchability**: Historical logs remain accurate and searchable
- **Consistency**: Avoids confusion when reviewing past work
- **Pattern recognition**: Future session capture can build on consistent naming
- **Documentation integrity**: Reference materials maintain accurate paths

**Why z_context specifically**: The `z_` prefix preserves the original intent (sorting to end) while solving the practical typing and compatibility issues that prompted the change.

## Changes Made

**Git repositories updated and committed:**
- `Razzo/` - Folder rename + CLAUDE.md reference update
- `Chief of Staff/` - 4 historical log files updated

**Files modified across projects (13 total):**
- `Razzo/CLAUDE.md` - folder structure + description
- `Beekeeper Group/CLAUDE.md` - shared context pointer
- `Mythos-More Vang/CLAUDE.md` - local folder ref + shared context pointer
- `SalesIntel/CLAUDE.md` - shared context pointer
- `Party Rental/CLAUDE.md` - shared context pointer
- `Beekeeper Group/reference-materials.md` - file paths
- `Beekeeper Group/2026-Proposal/engagement-model-notes.md` - source material paths
- `Beekeeper Group/Meetings/.../engagement-model-notes.md` - source material paths
- `Beekeeper Group/logs/20260203-client-onboarding.md` - context references
- `Chief of Staff/Check-Ins/daily/20260130-morning.md` - historical references
- `Chief of Staff/Check-Ins/thoughts/20260131-context-profile-framework-value.md` - historical references
- `Chief of Staff/logs/20260201-cpf-auth-routing-fix.md` - historical references
- `Chief of Staff/logs/20260203-client-onboarding.md` - historical references

**Verification performed:**
- Checked disk state vs. references before changes
- Confirmed Mythos-More Vang already had `z_context` folder
- Identified Razzo still had `Ω_context` folder requiring rename
- Cross-referenced all file updates against actual folder structure

## Open Items

None identified - the rename is complete and consistent across the project ecosystem.
