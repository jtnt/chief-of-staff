# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Project:** Chief of Staff
**Session ID:** test-fixed-parsing
**Session Type:** Auto-captured

Let me finish that thought. Here's a complete approach:

1. **First, save this session's work:**
   ```bash
   /save  # This will create a manual log
   ```

2. **To preserve the config changes:**
   ```bash
   # In ~/.claude directory
   git init
   git add scripts/capture-session.sh commands/save.md
   git commit -m "Update auto-capture and save workflow"
   ```

3. **When you close this session:**
   - It should auto-capture to `Chief of Staff/logs/`
   - You can verify by checking that directory after closing

**Recover options if something goes wrong:**
- The full transcript is saved at `/Users/jtnt/.claude/projects/-Users-jtnt-Documents-Projects-Chief-of-Staff/[session-uuid].jsonl`
- You can always re-open this session from that file

**What to check after closing:**
1. Look in `Chief of Staff/logs/` for a new `*-session.md`
2. Check `~/.claude/[[logs/capture-session.log]]`
3. Check `~/.claude/[[logs/capture-errors.log]]` for any issues

Want me to walk you through exactly how to close and verify?
