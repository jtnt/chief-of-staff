# Chief of Staff: Morning Checkin Briefing

## What Was Done

1. **Morning strategic briefing** - User requested full briefing after initial incomplete response. Claude executed the full briefing template: checked both calendars (one 3pm webinar on AI pipeline generation), assessed all project health from logs, checked content/writing status, and scanned for meetings.

2. **Morning check-in captured** - User shared their LinkedIn post about the "Claude Code bubble" and their focus for the day (continuing CPF agent framework work). Created morning check-in file at [[Check-Ins/daily/20260129-morning.md]].

3. **LinkedIn post filed** - Filed the "Claude Code Bubble" post to [[Writing/Published/20260129_claude-code-bubble/post.md]]. Post is about the gap between AI power users recommending command-line tools and the reality that most people don't even pay for ChatGPT. Categorized under Razzo (AI training alignment).

4. **Image reference issue** - Attempted to copy screenshot as companion image but hit file access issues. Resolved by referencing the original screenshot path in the post metadata.

## Key Decisions

- Categorized the LinkedIn post under **Razzo** project (relates to AI training and adoption messaging, aligns with the training business)
- Referenced image from original Screenshots location rather than copying (file access issue workaround)

## Reasoning

- **Why Razzo over standalone:** The post directly addresses AI training methodology and the gap between power users and normal people - this is core Razzo positioning around practical AI enablement vs advanced tooling.

## Changes Made

- Created: [[Check-Ins/daily/20260129-morning.md]]
- Created: [[Writing/Published/20260129_claude-code-bubble/post.md]]

## Open Items

- User continuing CPF agent framework work (building core document generation agents)
- 3pm webinar: "AI Tools & Techniques to generate Pipeline in the Age of AI Search & 35% Lower CTR" (TJ Fredrick)
