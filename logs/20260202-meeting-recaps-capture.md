# Chief of Staff: Meeting Recaps Capture

## What Was Done

Captured meeting recaps from two significant conversations:

**Glen Hellman Meeting** - Two AI training opportunities emerged:
1. **NSF I-Corps Mid-Atlantic Hub mentor role** - Teaching lean-startup methodology to PhD researchers across 8+ major universities (UMD, Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, etc.)
2. **Georgetown Learning Centers partnership** - Brick and mortar training facility that has attempted AI curriculum but hit challenges

**Awarehouse Weekly Mastermind** - User offered pro bono marketing services for April in exchange for facility access (sauna/cold plunge). Noted opportunities they're not capitalizing on due to lack of marketing experience.

All items were properly captured and routed:
- Razzo opportunities → cos-inbox.md and meeting log
- Awarehouse commitment → thought capture in Check-Ins

## Key Decisions

Routed AI training opportunities to Razzo project as they align with the core business. Kept Awarehouse commitment as personal thought since it's pro bono exchange rather than business opportunity.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Cross-referenced with git - only one new file created:**

**Chief of Staff files:**
- `Check-Ins/thoughts/20260202-awarehouse-marketing-commitment.md` - Captured pro bono marketing commitment

**External project files (read-only for CoS):**
- Added Glen Hellman meeting opportunities to Razzo cos-inbox.md
- Created detailed meeting log in Razzo project

## Open Items

None identified - routine capture session completed successfully.
