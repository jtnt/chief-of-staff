# Chief of Staff: Auto-Memory System Questions

## What Was Done

User asked clarifying questions about the auto-memory system visible in `/context` output:
- What the "Memory files" section represents
- What MEMORY.md is and how it works
- Current content of Chief of Staff's MEMORY.md
- Version history of the feature

Provided explanations of:
- Three memory file types (global CLAUDE.md, project CLAUDE.md, project MEMORY.md)
- Auto-memory system purpose and characteristics
- Version info (introduced v2.1.32, expanded v2.1.33)
- Current Chief of Staff MEMORY.md content showing session capture notes, task system rules, and project-specific quirks

## Key Decisions

No decisions made - informational session only.

## Reasoning

Routine informational session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files modified. Only read:
- [[memory/MEMORY.md]] (to display current content)

## Open Items

None identified.
