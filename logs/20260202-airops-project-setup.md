# Chief of Staff: Airops Project Setup

## What Was Done

Created new project tracking for "AirOps Cohort Feb 2026" after user joined an AI marketing cohort and needed to track homework assignments. Full project setup completed:

**Project Structure Created:**
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/AirOps Cohort Feb 2026/` with standard folders (logs/, session-patterns/, Homework/, Notes/, Workflows/)
- `CLAUDE.md` with project context and AI marketing cohort guidelines
- `project-knowledge.md` tracking Session 1 status and open items

**Chief of Staff Integration:**
- Added project to `project-sources.md` for tracking
- Added to `project-index.md` with comprehensive project summary
- Established task persistence workflow for cohort homework

**Specific Tasks Captured:**
1. Watch Session 1 recording (prerequisite)
2. Complete Session 1 homework (Brand Kit + Competitive Intelligence workflow modification)
3. Submit homework for $100 AirOps credit incentive

Session highlighted the difference between session-scoped tasks (Claude Code's task list) vs. persistent tasks (project-knowledge.md), leading to proper task persistence in the project file.

## Key Decisions

- **New project warranted:** AirOps cohort is structured program with multiple sessions, homework, and workflows - justified dedicated tracking vs. routing to existing projects
- **Task persistence approach:** Moved from session-scoped to project-persistent tracking to ensure homework tasks survive session end
- **Project classification:** Set as "Learning/Professional Development" type in project tracking

## Reasoning

**Why new project over existing:** User initially considered routing to Writing or Job Search, but cohort's structured nature (multiple sessions, homework assignments, workflow building) warranted dedicated space. This pattern will repeat for other structured learning programs.

**Task persistence insight:** Session revealed gap between temporary session tasks and permanent project tracking. Established workflow: create tasks in session for immediate work, then persist critical ones to project-knowledge.md for long-term tracking.

## Changes Made

**Always verify changes against git — don't rely solely on transcript analysis:**

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short 2>/dev/null

# Check recent commits from this session (within last 2 hours)
git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago" --name-only 2>/dev/null
```

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `project-sources.md` - Added AirOps Cohort project entry with source path and key files
- `project-index.md` - Added comprehensive project summary under Active Projects
- Created new project folder: `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/AirOps Cohort Feb 2026/` with complete structure
- New project files: `CLAUDE.md`, `project-knowledge.md` with Session 1 homework tracking

**Git Status Verification:** Project creation was meta-work on Chief of Staff system - changes to CoS tracking files confirmed above.

## Open Items

1. **User needs to watch Session 1 recording** - prerequisite for homework completion
2. **Complete Session 1 homework** - Brand Kit updates and Competitive Intelligence workflow modification
3. **Submit homework for $100 credit** - includes workspace ID requirement
4. **Monitor cohort progress** - future sessions will need similar tracking structure
