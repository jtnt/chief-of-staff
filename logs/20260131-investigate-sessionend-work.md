# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

Investigated previous SessionEnd script work by searching through recent session transcripts. The user was trying to understand what SessionEnd automation work had been done previously, since that work wouldn't be captured in regular project logs (being meta-work about the capture system itself).

Key activities:
- Searched recent session logs in CoS to understand recent work
- Examined recent session transcripts from home directory (~/.claude/projects/-Users-jtnt/)
- Used Task agent with Explore subagent to search multiple transcript files for SessionEnd-related content
- Attempted to reconstruct the timeline and status of SessionEnd script development

The session revealed the challenge of tracking meta-work that improves the tracking system itself - a recursive documentation problem.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions made - this was primarily an investigative session to understand previous work context.

## Reasoning

Routine investigative session - no notable reasoning patterns to capture. The user was trying to understand the current state of SessionEnd automation work that had been done in previous sessions.

## Changes Made

**Git verification shows:**
```bash
# Uncommitted changes: logs/20260130-discuss-output-style.md (untracked)
# No recent commits from this session
```

No files were modified during this session. This was purely an investigative session focused on reading and understanding previous work. One untracked log file exists from a previous session but was not part of this session's work.

## Open Items

- Complete understanding of SessionEnd script current state and any remaining work
- Potential need to better document meta-work that improves the capture system itself
- Consider how to better track work on the tracking system to avoid this recursive documentation gap
