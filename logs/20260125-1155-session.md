# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-25 11:55 AM EST

## Summary
Investigated and diagnosed a critical duplication issue in the session logging workflow where both the `/save` command and auto-capture script were creating redundant logs with inconsistent quality. Identified three root causes: broken duplicate detection logic, architectural quality gap between manual and automated logging, and maintenance burden of two parallel systems. Decided to consolidate to a single, unified logging system.

## Key Points
- **Duplicate logs problem**: `/save` and auto-capture were creating separate logs minutes apart due to mismatched session ID markers
- **Quality gap identified**: Auto-capture uses Haiku API with truncated transcripts (100KB max) and generic prompts; `/save` captures full context with human judgment
- **Architectural issue**: Two systems doing the same job creates coordination overhead and points of failure
- **Decision made**: Remove auto-capture entirely and consolidate to `/save` command as single source of truth
- **Key files identified**: `capture-session.sh`, `.claude-session-marker`, `/save` command implementation

## Open Items
- Finalize removal of auto-capture infrastructure and verify no orphaned processes remain
- Update documentation to reflect `/save` as the only session logging mechanism
- Test workflow to ensure no edge cases in the consolidated system
