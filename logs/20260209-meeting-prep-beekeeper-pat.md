# Chief of Staff: Meeting Prep: Beekeeper and Pat Intro

## What Was Done

Delivered morning strategic briefing and prepared comprehensive research briefs for two afternoon meetings:

**Beekeeper Group call (3:00 PM):**
- Meeting titled "AI Next Steps" with Alex Dickinson, Managing Partner & Chief of Staff
- Researched Alex's background: 14 years at Beekeeper, GWU adjunct professor, C-SPAN background
- Beekeeper Group is award-winning DC public affairs agency (20 person team, founded 2010)
- Contextualized against Feb 3 "Let's Talk AI" meeting (sales/biz dev priority, CPF resonance) and Feb 4 Apollo demo
- Identified open items: follow-up resources not sent, engagement model proposal pending, Apollo evaluation incomplete
- Key insight: This is a 1:1 (not full team) titled "AI Next Steps" — Alex has regrouped internally and is coming back with direction

**Patrick Schaber intro call (3:30 PM):**
- Fresh contact (no prior mentions in any projects)
- Director of Marketing at GovDocs + runs GTM & AI consulting practice
- Positioning nearly identical to Razzo: AI + GTM consultant, workshop/transformation projects, fractional leadership tier
- His framework: SIRCO Prompting, his Substack: "Approachable AI"
- Geographic separation (Minneapolis vs DC) suggests peer/ally rather than competition
- User confirmed "peer/ally" classification — meeting is for comparing notes and potential referral sharing

**Morning briefing covered:**
- Calendar: 5 meetings including back-to-back Beekeeper + Pat calls
- Project health: CPF and SalesIntel active, Razzo/Beekeeper need attention, Job Search stalled
- Content: 2 drafts sitting since Feb 3, last publish Jan 29
- Inbox: 1 active task (I-Corps mentor prep with 3 sub-tasks)
- Meta-work warning: 85% (77/90 sessions)

**Task update:** Moved all I-Corps sub-tasks from `due:2026-02-09` to `due:2026-02-10` at user request.

## Key Decisions

**Meeting positioning:** Treat Beekeeper call as listening session (they've regrouped, let Alex lead) rather than pitching. Pat call is peer networking, not competitive assessment.

## Reasoning

**Why deep research on both contacts:**
- Beekeeper: This is transition from exploratory to decision-making (title "AI Next Steps" signals they've regrouped). Needed full context on Alex's role and strategic position at firm to understand her lens.
- Pat: Unknown contact organizing a meeting requires understanding positioning overlap. Geographic separation + similar offerings could mean collaboration opportunity rather than competition.

**Why comparison table for Pat:**
The side-by-side framework (Razzo vs Patrick Schaber) made the positioning overlap immediately clear and actionable. Similar enough to learn from each other, different enough (geography, specific frameworks) to not compete.

## Execution Plan

**For Beekeeper call:**
1. Listen for what they decided internally
2. Acknowledge if follow-up resources weren't sent
3. Ask about Apollo outcome (did Tanya follow up?)
4. Let Alex frame the engagement model (training vs fractional CAIO vs project work)
5. Note that 30-min 1:1 format suggests Alex is personally driving this forward

**For Pat call:**
- Find out what prompted the intro (how he found you)
- Compare notes on packaging AI consulting
- Identify referral opportunities across geographies
- Discuss workshop/transformation tier approaches (your Sprint vs his model)
