# Chief of Staff: Trivial Session

## What Was Done

User tested the `/color` command (CLI UI color customization) and invoked `/link` to capture a research article. The `/link` skill ran successfully and saved content to the Context Profile Framework project. This main session performed no substantive work — all activity was delegated to the skill subprocess.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files were modified in this session. All file changes (research capture to CPF project) occurred within the `/link` skill subprocess.

## Open Items

None identified.
