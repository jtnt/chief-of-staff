# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

Performed cross-project git status check and committed/pushed pending changes across all tracked projects.

Three projects had uncommitted changes:
- **Razzo** - 9 files: meetings folder, cos-inbox, session logs
- **Context Profile Framework** - 9,010 files changed: removed remotion-context-profiles folder (1.8M lines deleted), added Mythos case study files
- **Chatbot Linebreaker** - 95 files: .claude/ folder with GSD framework, .gitignore for .DS_Store

All three committed and pushed successfully.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions - routine git housekeeping.

## Reasoning

The CPF commit was notably large because the `remotion-context-profiles/node_modules/` folder had been accidentally committed. Removing it cleaned up the repository significantly.

## Changes Made

Git operations across external projects:
- Razzo: committed + pushed to main
- Context Profile Framework: committed + pushed to main
- Chatbot Linebreaker: committed + pushed to main

## Open Items

None identified.
