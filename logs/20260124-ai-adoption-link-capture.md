# Chief of Staff: Ai Adoption Link Capture

**Date:** 2026-01-24 07:53 AM EST
**Session Type:** meta-work

## What Was Done

Captured and processed a link to an AI adoption article from AI Ready RVA. Initial save attempted to fetch article content but WebFetch failed to retrieve full content. User provided the complete article text, which was then processed and saved to the Links system with comprehensive summary.

Created structured link entry at [[Links/Business/20260124-ai-adoption-success-ai-ready-rva.md]] with:
- Full article text
- 8-step AI adoption framework
- Case studies (McKinsey "Lily", Bank of America)
- Monday Morning Checklist for leaders
- Tagged for Razzo project relevance

## Key Decisions

User clarified expectations for link summaries: wants clean extraction of article content and key steps/frameworks, not strategic analysis or application insights. Adjusted link capture format accordingly.

## Changes Made

**New files:**
- [[Links/Business/20260124-ai-adoption-success-ai-ready-rva.md]] - AI adoption article with 8-step framework

**Modified files:**
- (None - new link file only)

## Open Items

- User was asked if they want this link added to Razzo's project inbox (pending response)
- Morning check-in was offered but not yet addressed
