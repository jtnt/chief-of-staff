# Chief of Staff: Two New Client Setup

## What Was Done

Set up tracking for two new clients added to the `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/` folder:

**Beekeeper Group** (already partially tracked):
- Updated project-sources.md with actual key files found in the folder
- Confirmed existing entry in project-index.md was complete
- Status: Active client project with comprehensive meeting materials and analysis
- Key finding: Sales/biz dev is priority #1 (not AI adoption training)

**Party Rental** (new client setup):
- Added to project-sources.md (lines 87-90)
- Added comprehensive entry to project-index.md (lines 663-680)
- Transcribed team meeting audio file: "thoughts on AI from Gary and others.m4a" (3.7MB)
- Created analysis document: `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Party Rental/20260203-ai-team-discussion-analysis.md`
- Moved transcript to main folder with proper naming: `20260203-ai-team-discussion-transcript.txt`

**Key insight discovered:** Both clients are in very similar situations - bottom-up AI adoption happening at individual level, but no clear collective business strategy. The difference is Beekeeper has articulated an immediate tactical need (Apollo CRM work) while Party Rental has an aspirational vision (end-to-end event planning AI) without current pain points.

## Key Decisions

- Used standard client tracking format for both entries in project-index.md
- Categorized both as "Active - Client Project"
- Placed Party Rental transcript and analysis in main project folder (not _context) for visibility
- Maintained consistency with existing client tracking structure (SalesIntel format)

## Reasoning

**Why transcribe and analyze immediately:** The audio file contained substantive strategic discussion that needed to be accessible for client engagement planning. Raw audio files don't surface insights effectively in the tracking system.

**Why both clients are fundamentally similar:** Initial assessment showed they're both experiencing uncoordinated individual AI adoption without business strategy. The engagement approach (discovery → strategic guidance → implementation) could be nearly identical despite different surface presentations.

## Changes Made

**Git shows no uncommitted changes** - indicates this was primarily a Chief of Staff organizational session rather than creating new client deliverables.

**Files examined and organized:**
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Beekeeper Group/` - comprehensive meeting materials and analysis already present
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Clients/Party Rental/_context/` - audio file transcribed and analyzed
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Chief of Staff/project-sources.md` - updated with Party Rental entry
- `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Chief of Staff/project-index.md` - updated with Party Rental comprehensive entry and last updated date

**New files created in Party Rental project:**
- `20260203-ai-team-discussion-transcript.txt` - moved from _context folder
- `20260203-ai-team-discussion-analysis.md` - strategic analysis of team discussion

## Open Items

**Beekeeper Group:**
- Send promised articles to Alex
- Explore tactical CRM support opportunities
- Develop Context Profile Framework presentation

**Party Rental:**
- Validate analysis with user
- Identify immediate quick-win opportunity
- Schedule discovery session with leadership team

**Chief of Staff system:**
- Both clients now properly tracked and ready for strategic engagement
- Audio transcription workflow worked well for capturing unstructured client insights
