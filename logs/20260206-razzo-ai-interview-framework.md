# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

Captured YouTube video "Don't Prompt AI. Let It Prompt You" by Dylan Davis (Gradient Labs) as training material for Razzo. The video presents a 4-layer framework for having AI interview you instead of you prompting it — producing deeper clarity through 25-30 adaptive questions.

**Content saved to:** `Razzo/Research/20260205_ai-interview-framework/`
- Full cleaned transcript with structured sections
- Training-oriented analysis with:
  - Framework tables (role, goal buckets, mechanic, guardrails)
  - Copy-paste template prompt for exercises
  - Sprint/Bootcamp integration ideas
  - Connections to Razzo's positioning (extraction bucket maps to knowledge capture)
- Created Research INDEX.md for Razzo project

**Framework summary:**
1. **Role** (swappable): Expert interviewer + domain specialization
2. **Goal** (swappable): Strategy, Extraction, Clarity, or Preparation
3. **Mechanic** (static): "Ask me one question at a time, adapting based on my answers"
4. **Guardrails** (static): Cap at ~30 questions, specify end output format

Analysis positioned this as teachable content with concrete module structure for Sprint demo sessions.

## Key Decisions

- Saved to Razzo (not CoS) as training-specific research
- Analysis framed for teaching/training use (template prompts, module outlines)
- Renamed folder from `...-dylan-davis-gradient-labs` to `...-ai-interview-framework` for cleaner naming

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Razzo project (external):**
- Created `Research/20260205_ai-interview-framework/transcript.md`
- Created `Research/20260205_ai-interview-framework/analysis.md`
- Created `Research/INDEX.md`
- Renamed folder (removed `-dylan-davis-gradient-labs` suffix)

**Chief of Staff:**
- No files modified (this was cross-project work)

## Open Items
