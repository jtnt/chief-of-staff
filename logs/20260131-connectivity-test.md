# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

Trivial session - basic connectivity test with "test" and "testing" messages, followed by immediate session exits. No actual work was performed.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Always verify changes against git — don't rely solely on transcript analysis:**

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short 2>/dev/null

# Check recent commits from this session (within last 2 hours)
git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago" --name-only 2>/dev/null
```

Only this log file was created during the capture process. No files were modified during the original session.

## Open Items

None identified.
