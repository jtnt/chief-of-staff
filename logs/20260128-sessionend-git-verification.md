# Chief of Staff: Sessionend Git Verification

## What Was Done

Quick verification session where user asked whether the SessionEnd auto-capture system commits and pushes to git. Claude confirmed from CLAUDE.md documentation, then verified by reading the actual hook script (`~/.claude/hooks/session-end.sh`) and skill file (`~/.claude/skills/session-capture/SKILL.md`).

## Key Decisions

No major decisions. This was a verification/clarification session.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No changes. Read-only verification of existing auto-capture system.

## Open Items

None identified.
