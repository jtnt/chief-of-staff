# Chief of Staff: Claude Code Project Switching

## What Was Done

Answered a question about Claude Code functionality. User wanted to know if there's a way to switch projects/directories within an active Claude Code session without exiting and restarting.

**Answer provided:** No direct way to change working directory mid-session. Offered three alternatives:
1. Use `--add-dir` flag to access files in other directories while keeping current working directory
2. Run parallel sessions in different terminals/directories
3. Standard exit → cd → restart workflow

Explained that `--add-dir` is likely most useful for multi-project workflows, with the caveat that git operations still target the primary directory.

## Key Decisions

## Reasoning

Simple informational session - no notable reasoning to capture.
