**Date:** 2026-01-22 12:56 PM EST
**Session Type:** project-work

## What Was Done

Processed 4 recent meetings (Jan 15-21) using the meeting review system:

1. **Maven LIVE: How to use AI for Account Executives** (Jan 15, webinar)
   - Saved raw transcript and generated summary
   - Extracted key frameworks (4-part workflow, prompt formula)
   - Analyzed how content validates Razzo's approach

2. **More Vang / Mythos AI Training - Day 4** (Jan 15, client meeting)
   - Used external Gemini transcript file
   - Created comprehensive showcase session summary
   - Documented all participant presentations and learnings
   - Routed follow-ups to Razzo inbox (Jon Budington engagement)

3. **Building AI Champions in 2026** (Jan 15, webinar)
   - Processed Section/Manulife Champions program content
   - Extracted frameworks for AI adoption enablement
   - Connected insights to Razzo positioning and GTM strategy

4. **The Level 5 SKO with Marcus Sheridan** (Jan 21, webinar)
   - Processed 90-minute webinar (364 transcript segments)
   - Captured Honest Agreement and Pushback Pivot frameworks
   - Analyzed SKO critique and weekly training validation

All meetings matched with Granola transcripts via Python script, summaries created with strategic "How This Applies" sections for Razzo work, raw transcripts saved to Meeting Transcripts folder.

## Key Decisions

- Used external transcript for More Vang meeting (Google Meet Notes by Gemini) instead of Granola recording
- Routed all meeting summaries to project-specific locations (Razzo vs Chief of Staff)
- Created follow-up entries in Razzo inbox for client engagement opportunities
- Updated processed-meetings.json tracking file with new schema (projects array, meeting_type field)
