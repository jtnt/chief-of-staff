# Chief of Staff: Applied Ai Society Research

## What Was Done

**Research capture triggered by user sharing Applied AI Society URL** with intent to learn from their positioning for Razzo and writing content pillars.

**Initial capture (via /link skill):**
- User running from Chief of Staff directory
- Skill correctly prompted for project selection
- User selected Razzo as target project
- Created research subfolder: `Razzo/research/20260207_Applied-AI-Society/`
- Saved content.md (Applied AI Society mission, beliefs, approach)
- Generated initial analysis.md with positioning lessons

**Critical correction by user:**
User pointed out fundamental positioning error in my analysis: "Applied AI engineers' positioning of bridging the gap between the models and the business is that you got people focus on the tech, but the focus should be on the business. And when you say the sprint participants become AI workflow builders, that's putting the emphasis on the tech. The idea isn't to make these people AI workflow builders, it's to make them more effective in their job."

**This revealed two problems with initial analysis:**
1. Misunderstood the "bridge" concept — it's about shifting focus from tech to business, not creating a new identity
2. Copied too much of Applied AI Society's model instead of extracting what's actually useful for Razzo

**Revised analysis (simplified):**
Stripped down to three genuinely useful insights:
1. "No hype. Real implementation" — own this as explicit brand positioning
2. Business outcomes over tech features — frame around what people accomplish at their actual job, not what they learn
3. Live problem-solving validates action learning — their format proves the Sprint model works

**Files created in Razzo project:**
- `research/20260207_Applied-AI-Society/content.md`
- `research/20260207_Applied-AI-Society/analysis.md`
- Updated `research/INDEX.md`
- Updated `project-knowledge.md` (added Market & Competitive Landscape section with pointer to research)

## Key Decisions

**Simplified analysis instead of comprehensive positioning framework:** User's correction revealed I was over-indexing on Applied AI Society's specific model (community-based, open meetup, "Applied AI Engineer" identity) rather than extracting what's actually transferable to Razzo (B2B service with Sprint model). Chose to strip analysis down to just three useful insights.

**Extraction principle:** When capturing competitive/market research, focus on what's genuinely applicable to the project's specific business model, not comprehensive analysis of everything the other org does.

## Reasoning

**Why the "bridge" concept matters:** Applied AI Society's positioning works because it shifts the conversation from "learn this technology" to "solve this business problem." This is the actual value proposition. When I said Sprint participants "become AI workflow builders," I made them tech-focused instead of business-focused — exactly the wrong move.

**Why simplification was right:** The first analysis had 8 positioning lessons and 4 content pillars. Most were me copying Applied AI Society's model (community structure, professional practice framing, three personas) which don't apply to Razzo's B2B service. The simplified version has just three insights that actually transfer: brand positioning ("no hype"), outcome framing (business results not tech features), and validation (live problem-solving works).

**Pattern to remember:** When analyzing competitive positioning, ask "what about their specific business model makes this work for them, and does our model share that characteristic?" Don't copy what works for open communities into B2B services, or vice versa.

## Changes Made

**Razzo project files modified:**

```bash
# New research files created
/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/research/20260207_Applied-AI-Society/content.md
/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/research/20260207_Applied-AI-Society/analysis.md

# Index and manifest updated
/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/research/INDEX.md
/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/project-knowledge.md
```

**content.md:** Full capture of Applied AI Society's mission, beliefs, approach from their Meetup page

**analysis.md (final version):** Three useful insights for Razzo positioning:
- "No hype. Real implementation" brand positioning
- Business outcomes over tech features framing
- Live problem-solving validates Sprint model

**INDEX.md:** Added entry for Applied AI Society research (date: 2026-02-07, type: positioning-research)

**project-knowledge.md:** Added "Market & Competitive Landscape" section under Threads with pointer to new research

**Chief of Staff:** No files modified (this session was about Razzo research capture, not CoS system work)

## Open Items

None identified. Research captured, analysis corrected, files saved to Razzo project.
