**Date:** January 9, 2026 (night)
**Source:** `/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Chief of Staff`

## Recent Git Activity

- 97db6b0 Initial commit: Chief of Staff knowledge management system

## Current State

The Chief of Staff knowledge management system is operational with:
- Core structure in place (project-knowledge.md, project-sources.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Two-way sync workflows established
- Tracking 4 projects: Razzo, CPF, Caregiver App, and Chief of Staff itself
- GitHub repo established: https://github.com/jtnt/chief-of-staff.git

## Recent Work

**Session focus:** Refining the `/update-knowledge` workflow and reminder system

1. **Stop hook experimentation:**
   - Tested prompt-based Stop hook for `/update-knowledge` reminders
   - Hook worked but showed unavoidable "error" messages when blocking
   - Token cost was negligible (~$0.10-0.20/month)
   - Concluded UX issues outweighed benefits

2. **CLAUDE.md instruction approach:**
   - Removed Stop hook entirely
   - Added "Session Workflow" instruction to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - Claude now sees reminder at session start and acts naturally
   - Zero noise, zero token cost, simpler implementation

3. **Documentation & resources:**
   - Added Claude Code hooks reference to Resources/
   - Added slash commands documentation to Resources/
   - Ingested both to understand Claude Code capabilities

4. **GitHub setup:**
   - Initialized git repo
   - Created .gitignore (excludes .DS_Store, .claude/)
   - Pushed to https://github.com/jtnt/chief-of-staff.git

5. **Command improvements:**
   - Fixed `/update-cos` to use correct Chief of Staff path
   - Enhanced `/update-knowledge` to prompt for Chief of Staff sync

## Open Items

- SessionStart auto-sync workflow (postponed - focusing on simpler solutions first)
- Monitor effectiveness of CLAUDE.md reminder approach
- Consider whether other workflows would benefit from similar instruction-based patterns
