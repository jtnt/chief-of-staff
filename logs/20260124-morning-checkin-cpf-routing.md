# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-24 11:36 AM EST
**Session Type:** meta-work

## What Was Done

Conducted morning check-in capturing Saturday work plans (jtnt.io migration, CPF strategic thinking, JRAD setup). Main focus was CPF-related strategic insights from LinkedIn discussion with Joe Rhew about context repo automation.

Captured three structural challenges framework (creation, access/relevance, maintenance) and Joe Rhew's competitive intelligence (his approaches to access/relevance challenge using default compositions and agentic search).

Routed all CPF-related content to Context Profile Framework project:
- Added 3 items to CPF's cos-inbox.md (three challenges framework, Joe Rhew approaches, Chris McConnell meeting notes)
- Created log in CPF project documenting strategic insights

Also captured reference to advanced context network discussion from yesterday's Chris McConnell meeting.

## Key Decisions

User clarified that all CPF strategic thinking should be routed to CPF project, not kept in Chief of Staff. Applied bidirectional flow to push morning check-in insights to CPF inbox.

User noted Joe Rhew is technically a competitor (building context profiles for clients, targeting GTM niche) but there's room for collaboration and good dialog has been established.
