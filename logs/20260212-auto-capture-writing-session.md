# Chief of Staff: Auto-Capture Writing Session

## What Was Done

Session-capture skill was triggered for a Chief of Staff session, but the actual work took place in the Writing project. This was an extensive iterative writing session where the user:

1. **Brain dump on AI writing series** - User shared four interconnected post ideas about chatbots vs agentic tools, mindset shifts, automation building, and skills
2. **Synthesized into series plan** - Created structured plan for 4-post LinkedIn series plus Substack compilation in [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Writing/Drafts/20260211_how-to-work-with-ai-series/plan.md]]
3. **Drafted Post 1** - Multiple iterations on "chatbots vs agents" post explaining the difference between Claude.ai, Cowork, and Claude Code
4. **Refined LinkedIn intro for video** - Created 5 versions of short post to accompany a video demo, addressing AI writing patterns and tone
5. **Reviewer agent experiment** - User requested creating a reviewer agent well-versed in their writing standards to check drafts

The session demonstrated heavy iteration on voice and tone, with particular focus on eliminating AI writing patterns (parallel structures, em-dashes, triple delivery, corporate phrases) and matching the user's published writing style.

## Key Decisions

**Writing approach:** Editor not ghostwriter - when user says "refine" or "adjust," preserve original structure and just fix specific issues rather than rewriting from scratch. This was clarified multiple times during the session.

**Series structure:** Four standalone LinkedIn posts that can be compiled into one Substack piece. Order: (1) Chatbots vs agents, (2) The retrospective, (3) Build the system, (4) Skills/"I know kung fu"

**Video post strategy:** Don't spoil the outcome - tease what happens in the video rather than explaining the results upfront. The video's power is watching the three tools behave differently, not being told why ahead of time.

## Reasoning

**Why iteration was necessary:** Early drafts consistently exhibited AI writing patterns (parallel structures, explanatory corporate voice) that didn't match the user's published work. The user's actual voice is more direct, less structured, with varied sentence rhythm and no forced analogies.

**Pattern to remember:** When the user provides examples of their writing and asks you to match that style, actually read and internalize those examples before drafting. Don't rely on generic "professional but casual" interpretation - their voice has specific characteristics (short punchy sentences mixed with longer ones, no em-dashes, no rule-of-three listing, direct statements over analogies).

**Thinking evolution:** Started treating this as explanatory content ("teach people about agentic AI") but the user's actual positioning was different: "show people what's already here and where things are headed, without telling them they need to use it." That stance shift was critical to getting the tone right.

## Changes Made

**Chief of Staff repo:** No files modified. This was a meta-work session triggered by SessionEnd hook.

**Writing project** (not committed from this session):
- Created [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Writing/Drafts/20260211_how-to-work-with-ai-series/plan.md]]
- Created [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Writing/Drafts/20260211_how-to-work-with-ai-series/chatbots-vs-agents.md]] (v1, v2, v3)
- Created [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/writing/drafts/20260211_how-to-work-with-ai-series/claude-chat-cowork-code.md]] (v1-v5)
- Moved video file from Downloads to series folder
- Updated [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Writing/project-knowledge.md]] with series task
- Read multiple published posts and writing standards files

## Open Items

- User will continue editing drafts after lunch (session ended before that)
- Posts 2-4 of the series need drafting (retrospective, build the system, skills)
- Substack compilation piece needs creation once individual posts are complete
- Final version (v5) of video post needs user's final approval before publishing
