# Chief of Staff: Daily Task Creation

## What Was Done

User identified four priorities for the day and requested task creation. Added four new tasks to the Inbox section of [[project-knowledge.md]]:

1. **Finalize and send Mythos MoreVang proposal to John Bunnington** - Proposal ready for final review and delivery
2. **Record Google Docs Auto Sync video** - Short video demo on syncing Google Docs to Claude Projects
3. **Create Beekeeper proposal** - New proposal development
4. **Start I-Corps Mentor prep work** - Begin preparation for I-Corps mentor program (linked to existing Active task)

User indicated they were working on the Mythos proposal in another session, so left the task as-is in Inbox.
