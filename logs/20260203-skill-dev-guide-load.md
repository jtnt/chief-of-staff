# Chief of Staff: Skill Dev Guide Load

## What Was Done

Loaded the skill development guide for Claude Code plugins. The user requested access to the skill-development skill from the plugin-dev plugin, which provides comprehensive guidance for creating effective skills within Claude Code plugins.

The loaded documentation covers:
- Complete skill creation workflow (6 steps)
- Progressive disclosure design principles
- Plugin-specific considerations for skill structure
- YAML frontmatter requirements with trigger phrases
- Writing style requirements (imperative/infinitive form)
- Directory structure conventions for skills, references, examples, and scripts
- Validation checklist and common mistakes to avoid

No actual skill development work was performed - this was purely loading reference material.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions made. This was a reference loading session.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files were modified. This was a read-only reference loading session.

## Open Items

None identified. The skill development guide is now available for future skill creation work.
