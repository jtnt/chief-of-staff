# Chief of Staff: Priority Tracking Implementation

**Session Type:** meta-work

## What Changed

Added priority tracking and focus-keeping capabilities to the Chief of Staff system.

### New "Current Priorities" Section in project-knowledge.md

User shared the stakes clearly: unemployed nearly a year, need revenue or need a job. This context was missing from the system.

**P0 Priorities established:**
- **Razzo:** Get clients for AI Workflow Sprint through outreach, events, targeted content
- **CPF:** Get 3-5 pilot customers to validate the service

Everything else (Chief of Staff infrastructure, LinkedIn tools, Caregiver App) is deprioritized.

### Updated Check-In Commands

**Morning check-in (`/morning`):**
- Now reads Current Priorities before starting
- Checks if planned work aligns with revenue goals
- Gently asks about misalignment

**Evening check-in (`/evening`):**
- Compares actual work vs. morning intentions and stated priorities
- Tracks patterns (what gets attention vs. skipped)
- Offers gentle observations without nagging

### Key Insight

The system was capturing *what happened* but not *what should happen*. User wants Chief of Staff to eventually intuit priorities from patterns, but in the short term, explicit priority setting + check-in alignment tracking bridges the gap.

## Journal Entries

Two journal entries created this session:
1. AI Walks meetup experience (networking, Dammon Burden @ ID.me as potential lead)
2. Personal reflection on Bob Weir

## Chief of Staff Role Clarified

"Keep you focused on Razzo and CPF revenue activities. Flag when you're drifting into non-priority work. Be proactive about this."
