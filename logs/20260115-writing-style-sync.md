# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-15 04:51 PM EST
**Session Type:** meta-work

## What Was Done

Expanded the writing style preferences section in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` based on user's accumulated preferences. Also captured a thought about AI context requirements.

## Key Decisions

- **Writing style lives in root CLAUDE.md** - Confirmed this is the right location (applies globally to personal/thought leadership writing)
- **Removed "short paragraphs" guidance** - User concerned it would result in the trendy single-sentence paragraph style, which they dislike
- **Em dashes qualified as "excessive"** - Not banned outright since user uses them, but overuse flagged
- **"Not just X, but Y" banned everywhere** - Clarified this pattern is forbidden in all forms, not just headings

## Changes Made

**`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Writing Style section:**
- Added rhetorical questions and self-deprecating humor as voice elements
- Added thematic bookending technique
- Created new **Structure & Format** subsection with:
  - Bullet points: effective but not excessive
  - Parallel structure in lists/examples
  - Structure should map to framework concepts
- Enhanced **Editing Approach** with:
  - Flag structural/clarity issues separately from typos/grammar
  - Concrete options rather than vague advice
  - "Sharpen, don't reshape" principle
- Added **Phrases to Avoid (AI-isms)** section:
  - "Here's the problem:"
  - "Why it matters:"
  - "Here's the unlock"
  - "... that actually matter..."
  - "... that get real results."
  - "Not just X, but Y" / "It's not just X, it's Y"
  - Excessive em dashes

**Thought capture:**
- Saved thought about AI context requirements to `Check-Ins/thoughts/20260115-thought-1640.md`
- Linked to CPF "Context is Everything" post
- Created `cos-inbox.md` for Context Profile Framework (empty - thought already in post)
