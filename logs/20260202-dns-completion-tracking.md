# Chief of Staff: Dns Completion Tracking

## What Was Done

**Trivial Claude session** - Only MCP reconnection and exit commands were executed within Claude.

**Actual work captured** - Manual completion of JRAD DNS configuration task:
- CNAME record for www subdomain added to DNS provider
- Task moved from project-index.md open items to new completed-items.md tracking file

**Created completed-items.md** - New chronological tracking system for completed tasks across all projects. First entry captures the JRAD DNS completion on 2026-02-02.

## Key Decisions

Created a new completed-items.md file to track finished tasks chronologically across all projects. This provides a permanent record of accomplishments that were previously just removed from project open items.

## Reasoning

**Why create completed-items.md:**
- Previously completed tasks just disappeared when removed from project-index.md
- No way to review what had been accomplished over time
- Chronological completion log provides accountability and progress visibility
- Separates active work tracking (project-index.md) from historical record (completed-items.md)

## Changes Made

**Files modified:**
- `project-index.md` - Removed completed DNS task from JRAD open items
- `completed-items.md` - New file created with DNS completion entry

**Git status shows:**
- Modified: project-index.md (removed completed task)
- Untracked: completed-items.md (new completion tracking file)

## Open Items

None identified. The completion tracking system is now in place and the DNS task is properly documented as finished.
