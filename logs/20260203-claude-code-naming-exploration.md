# Chief of Staff: Claude Code Naming Exploration

## What Was Done

Explored potential names for Claude Code with a musical/opus theme. Generated 60+ name options through iterative brainstorming, starting with names directly related to "opus" and evolving toward more name-like options.

**Key themes explored:**
- Musical terminology (Cadence, Forte, Aria, Prelude, Allegro)
- Performance terms (Maestro, Brio, Bravo, Primo)
- Instrument parts (Reed, Clef, Fret, Arco)
- Musical forms (Fugue, Canon, Rondo, Etude)
- Short, punchy name-like options (Ludo, Nico, Zeno, Rio)

**User preferences identified:**
- Liked "Coda" (almost "Code" + "a", sense of completion)
- Drawn to "Rondo" and "Clef" (musical but name-like)
- Almost sold on "Brio" (energy and vigor)
- Also liked "Ludo" (playful, Latin origin meaning "play")

**Final direction:** Short, energetic names with Italian/Latin roots that feel like actual names rather than just musical terms.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions - this was exploratory conversation about naming preferences.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Always verify changes against git — don't rely solely on transcript analysis:**

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short 2>/dev/null

# Check recent commits from this session (within last 2 hours)
git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago" --name-only 2>/dev/null
```

No files were modified during this session - purely conversational exploration.

## Open Items

None identified - this was a creative brainstorming session with no follow-up actions required.
