# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Project:** Chief of Staff
**Session ID:** 98d729b8-b84a-4d06-8f5f-71c9e13ce3b8
**Session Type:** Auto-captured

## Summary
This session explored improving the `/save` command's approach to capturing work across multiple sessions, identifying limitations in the current design for synthesizing work done since the last save.

## What Happened
The user raised concerns about the current `/save` implementation:
1. It only looks at the current session
2. Doesn't capture work done across multiple sessions
3. Risks losing or incompletely capturing work, especially in projects with multiple ongoing sessions

## User Feedback & Decisions
Key quote capturing the core concern: "What if I'm working on three different sessions inside CoS for a while. One is finished, so I run /save, but the others aren't finished."

## Key Insights
- Current `/save` is too narrow in scope, focusing only on the immediate session
- Need a more holistic approach that:
  - Tracks last save timestamp per project
  - Captures work across multiple sessions
  - Handles partially completed work gracefully

## Connections to Previous Work
- Continues the thread from earlier sessions about improving session capture and synthesis
- Builds on the "pull model" design discussed in previous Chief of Staff system planning

## What's Unfinished
- Detailed implementation of new `/save` approach
- Mechanism for tracking and synthesizing multi-session work
- Handling of partially completed sessions

## Files Changed
- None in this exploration phase

The session was primarily a design discussion about improving the work capture mechanism, identifying key challenges in the current approach.
