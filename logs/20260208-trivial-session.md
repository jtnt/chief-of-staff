# Chief of Staff: Trivial Session

## What Was Done

User asked a quick question: "Is there a rule either in the chief of staff claude.md file or the global one to use Wiki links when referencing files in other files?"

Answered that yes, the global CLAUDE.md has a WikiLinks rule under "Documentation Model" that specifies always using Obsidian-style WikiLinks (`[[filename]]`) for file references to create backlinks in Obsidian.

Session was just a Q&A - no files read, no work performed.

## Key Decisions

No decisions made.

## Reasoning

Routine question - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

No files were modified.

## Open Items

None identified.
