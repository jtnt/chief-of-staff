# Chief of Staff: Personal OS Research Capture

## What Was Done

Captured Carl Vellotti's guest post on AI Product Playbook — "How Carl Set Up His Personal OS in Claude Code" (published 2026-02-10) — into [[research/20260210_personal-os-claude-code-carl-vellotti/]].

Carl's system shares structural parallels with CoS (task management, knowledge persistence, workflow automation) but with notable architectural differences. His approach: consolidated GOALS.md for identity/priorities, workflow folders with scoped CLAUDE.md files, Knowledge/People/ for stakeholder tracking, _temp/ for low-friction capture, and strict discipline on keeping CLAUDE.md under 100 lines.

Analysis identified **5 specific ideas worth evaluating** for potential CoS improvements:

1. **GOALS.md** — Standalone priorities file vs burying "Current Priorities" 80 lines into project-knowledge.md
2. **Workflow folders with scoped CLAUDE.md** — Extend the SKILL.md pattern to broader repeatable processes (weekly reviews, proposal workflows)
3. **Knowledge/People/** — Systematic stakeholder/contact aggregation vs scattered across meeting notes
4. **_temp/ capture** — Zero-friction dump folder for mid-session notes that don't fit task format
5. **"Pointers over content" CLAUDE.md discipline** — Audit which sections could become linked files to reduce file size

Added backlog task: "Evaluate Personal OS ideas from Carl Vellotti article" linking to the analysis.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions — research capture and backlog routing.

## Reasoning

Routine research capture session — no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Created:**
- [[research/20260210_personal-os-claude-code-carl-vellotti/article.md]] — Full article text with frontmatter
- [[research/20260210_personal-os-claude-code-carl-vellotti/analysis.md]] — Analysis connecting to CoS architecture, 5 specific improvement ideas

**Modified:**
- [[research/INDEX.md]] — Added new entry to research table (newest first)
- [[project-knowledge.md]] — Updated timestamp, added backlog task

## Open Items

None — research captured, task backlogged for future evaluation.
