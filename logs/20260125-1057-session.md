# Chief of Staff: Session Log

**Date:** 2026-01-25 10:57 AM EST

## Summary
Identified and organized reference materials for future session-saving system improvements. Reviewed two existing conversation logging solutions and their documentation as inspiration for potential enhancements to the current system. Materials were properly filed in the Resources folder for later evaluation.

## Key Points
- Located two reference implementations: `conversation-logger` (sirkitree) and `cc-sessions` (GWUDCAP)
- Reviewed explanatory article on auto-save conversations by Jeradbitner
- Clarified these are inspirational references, not directives for immediate implementation
- Moved reference document to `Resources/Claude Code/session-saving-references.md`
- Updated `project-knowledge.md` with pointer to new resource location
- Confirmed current session-saving workflow is functioning (auto-capture, /save, /log, /evening commands)

## Open Items
- Revisit session-saving system design when ready to evaluate these approaches against current implementation
