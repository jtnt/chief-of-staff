# Chief of Staff: Trivial Session - Competitor Alternatives Skill Exploration

## What Was Done

User briefly explored the marketing-skills:competitor-alternatives skill by invoking `/marketing-skills:competitor-alternatives`. The skill loaded and provided comprehensive instructions for creating competitor comparison and alternative pages. When I checked for a product marketing context file (`.claude/product-marketing-context.md`) and found none, I explained the expected format for this file that would optimize the marketing skills workflow. User exited immediately after.

No actual competitor pages were created or work initiated beyond exploring the skill's capabilities.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions - routine skill exploration.

## Reasoning

Routine session - no notable reasoning to capture.

## Changes Made

**Git status shows:**
```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short 2>/dev/null

# Check recent commits from this session (within last 2 hours)
git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago" --name-only 2>/dev/null
```

No files were modified - this was a read-only exploration of skill documentation.

## Open Items

None identified - this was just a brief skill exploration.
