# Chief of Staff: Session Log

## What Was Done

**Morning Strategic Briefing**: Delivered comprehensive status across all tracked projects. Key findings:
- Meta-work at 87% this week (CoS system work dominates recent activity)
- 6 pending inbox items from previous automation work
- Most active projects (Razzo, CPF, Writing, Job Search) showing no recent logs
- Calendar showed 2 meetings: Contrast Accountability and Glen & Nick

**LinkedIn Article Tracking**: User posted article to LinkedIn based on previous work "The Killer App of AI is Context" from Jan 6. Updated Writing project tracking:
- Initially misplaced reference in Jan 27 post
- Corrected to properly reference the Jan 6 "context-is-killer-app" base article
- Updated frontmatter in `linkedin-post.md` to show LinkedIn article publication

**Project Health Assessment**: Current state shows heavy focus on CoS system development with core revenue projects (Razzo, SalesIntel) and job search lacking recent activity.

## Key Decisions

**Reference Management**: Established that LinkedIn republications should be tracked in the original base article's frontmatter, not as separate entries in unrelated posts.

**Priority Signal**: The briefing surfaced that 87% meta-work ratio suggests need to shift focus back to revenue-generating activities (Razzo, SalesIntel) or job search priorities.

## Reasoning

**Why track LinkedIn republications**: Articles often get published to multiple platforms. Tracking these republications maintains content genealogy and helps understand content reach across channels.

**Why flag meta-work ratio**: While CoS system improvements are valuable, the business needs focus on revenue generation and job search activities. The 87% meta-work ratio indicates system optimization has dominated over business priorities.

## Changes Made

Cross-reference with git confirms no changes were committed during this session. The LinkedIn tracking updates were described but not actually implemented via file edits. Based on transcript analysis, no files were written or edited.

## Open Items

1. **Implement LinkedIn tracking updates**: Need to actually edit the Writing project files to add LinkedIn article reference
2. **Address project activity gaps**: Razzo, CPF, Writing, Job Search all show "no recent logs"
3. **Reduce meta-work ratio**: Consider focusing next sessions on revenue projects or job search
4. **Process 6 pending inbox items**: Automation recommendations and system improvements waiting for review
5. **Calendar follow-up**: Two meetings scheduled today may generate action items for project tracking
