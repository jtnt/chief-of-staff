# Chief of Staff: Dc Founders Panel Research

**Date:** 2026-01-22 03:22 PM EST
**Session Type:** project-work

## What Was Done

Researched speakers for tonight's DC Founders Panel ("AI Use Cases & Startup Growth"). Launched parallel background agents to gather information on all four panelists (Jonathan Aberman/Hupside, Andrew Tsintsiruk/Rohic, Catherine McMillan/AI Collective, Jeff Berkowitz/Delve). Two agents completed successfully, two stalled and required direct web search.

Compiled comprehensive speaker dossiers including: background, company details, funding stage, relevance to CPF/Razzo work, and tailored icebreaker questions for networking. Sent formatted email to nicholas@razzohq.com with speaker research summary.

Key insight from discussion: Rohic (sales/marketing content automation) is solving a vertical-specific version of CPF's general problem — taking company data and making it useful in AI context. Rohic focuses on sales/marketing; CPF is the general-purpose platform. Discussion highlighted risks of general vs. vertical approach.

## Key Decisions

No major decisions this session. Research and networking prep only.

## Changes Made

- Added inbox item: "Follow-up: Nicholas & Ken intro call" with action items
- Email sent: Speaker research summary to nicholas@razzohq.com

## Open Items

- Attend panel tonight (6:00–8:00 PM @ WeWork, 1701 Rhode Island Ave NW)
- Test icebreaker questions with speakers, especially Andrew Tsintsiruk (Rohic) given direct relevance to CPF
- Consider: Should CPF pursue vertical beachhead approach (like Rohic) vs. proving generality upfront?
