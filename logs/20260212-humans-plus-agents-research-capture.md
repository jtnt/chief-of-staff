# Chief of Staff: Humans+Agents Research Capture

## What Was Done

User shared 7 URLs about Steve Cunningham's "Humans+Agents" AI operating system and requested full-text capture of all sources plus a synthesis. The research sits at the intersection of Razzo (consulting positioning) and CPF (context engineering validation).

**7 parallel agents deployed** to capture:

1. **GTM AI Podcast article** (`gtm-ai-podcast-claude-cowork-setup.md`, ~4,500 words) — Full writeup of Steve's system with practical implementation details: 7-step playbook, the Invoice Method (quantifying AI work output), org chart thinking (treat AI like a company with departments), continuous improvement loop (session wrap-ups → overnight system enhancements), HTML as universal format, competitive advantages framework (Distribution, Deployment/feedback loops, Data).

2. **Humansplusagents.ai site** (`humansplusagents-ai-site.md`, ~2,200 words) — Marketing page for the OS. 311 agents organized into 10 departmental modules (Marketing, Sales, Strategy, Product, Finance, Operations, HR, IT, Legal, Improvement). Three-tier pricing model: Platform ($1K/year), Transformation (custom), Managed (custom). Positioning: 90% automated, 10% expert oversight.

3. **Steve Cunningham LinkedIn profile** (`ai-steve-linkedin-profile.md`) — Background: 12 years running digital agency, Read It For Me founder (book summary platform made obsolete by ChatGPT), pivoted to AI-native operations, grew Simple Academy to 7 figures. Folder architecture approach: root "Operate" folder with COO onboarding file, functional department folders, each containing Advisors (decision frameworks), Agents (task instructions), Context files, Design System, Templates, and Projects. Every AI session starts with "read the COO folder and get yourself onboarded."

4. **ROI Association consultant book** (`roi-association-consultant-book.md`, ~5,200 words) — Chapter 0 of "The Full-Stack Consultant." Core thesis: **GDPval Study showing AI win rate against credentialed experts going from 12.4% (early 2024) to 70.9% (Dec 2025)** across 57 domains. Introduces the "50% threshold phase change" (below = AI as accelerant; above = AI as expert-level producer), the AI Arbitrage Window (brief period where context engineering mastery creates advantage), APQC Framework (1,297 processes across 13 enterprise functions), Performance Tax model (5 factors degrading AI capability: outdated models, insufficient context, vague specs, single-shot methodology, no testing), UCASE/SCOPE maturity framework (Understanding → Codification → Augmentation → Securing → Execution), 3 core skills (Creative/Critical/Systems Thinking), and the 729 Services Canon.

5. **ROI Association repertoire page** (`roi-association-repertoire.md`, ~7,500 words) — The full Canon of 729: **9 domains × 9 specialties × 9 projects** = every consulting engagement. Domains: Growth, Revenue, Capital, Talent, Ops, Tech, Strategy, Legal, Built Environment. Each project deliverable in 3 tiers (DIY $2K / Done With You $10K / Done For You $50K) = 2,187 service configurations. Includes "The Wedge" strategy (websites as entry point — most businesses have bad ones, AI removes Custom-vs-Template tradeoff, use it to get inside then sell the other 728 projects). Growth path: Day 1 master your 9 projects ($90-225K), Day 90 add neighboring specialty ($180-450K), Year 1 own full domain ($810K-2M+).

6. **ROI Association AI Folio page** (`roi-association-ai-folio.md`, ~8,200 words) — Publishing engine with Code/Paste/Publish workflow for deploying proposals, product pages, and interactive content. Three use cases: proposals in 5 min (vs. 72 hours traditional), product pages in 20 min, interactive content. Includes SPIN extraction + StoryBrand structure for proposal templates ("Overture"). Cross-references Repertoire, Atelier, and Consultant book content.

7. **ROI Association Atelier page** (`roi-association-atelier.md`) — The "AI Builders Studio." Weekly live-build sessions where Steve builds SaaS apps in real-time. Core argument: consultants who build "micro-assets" (small custom software for individual clients) become embedded infrastructure rather than replaceable vendors. Includes full code access, prompt libraries, architecture patterns, coaching, builder community.

**Synthesis file created** (`00-synthesis.md`) cross-referencing all sources with editorial notes on relevance to Razzo/CPF:
- Context engineering as the portable skill (validates CPF approach)
- Continuous improvement loop pattern (session wrap-ups → overnight system improvements)
- Micro-assets thesis (build tools, not just advice)
- Tradeoff collapse pattern (AI eliminates old either/or constraints)
- APQC framework as cross-domain map

**Correction mid-session:** Initially saved to `Chief of Staff/Resources/humans-plus-agents/`, user corrected that this belongs in Razzo. All 8 files moved to [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/Research/humans-plus-agents/]].

## Key Decisions

**Razzo placement, not CoS** — This research informs Razzo's consulting positioning and CPF methodology, not the Chief of Staff system itself. I initially misplaced it in CoS Resources; user corrected. Reinforces the standing rule: never guess which project something belongs to.

## Reasoning

**Why this matters for Razzo:**
- Validates the CPF thesis that context engineering is the bottleneck skill, not domain expertise
- Provides a competing framework (729 services canon) to evaluate against Razzo's positioning
- The "micro-assets" concept (consultants who build tools become infrastructure) could inform Razzo's service model — currently Razzo delivers insights/strategy, not software artifacts
- The continuous improvement loop pattern (session wrap-ups documenting what worked, what didn't, what to change) mirrors the CPF verification/iteration approach

**Why the GDPval study is significant:**
- If AI really crossed 50% win rate against experts, it means the coordination tax problem (enterprises can't find/afford/retain top expertise) got solved by capability rather than better matching
- The "AI Arbitrage Window" framing is useful — if context engineering advantage is temporary (lasts until good context becomes commoditized), then first-movers need to build moats through proprietary context assets
- This is exactly what CPF does — it creates irreplaceable context that compounds

**Pattern to remember:**
- When user shares multiple URLs with "capture all of these," always ask which project before saving, even if it seems obvious
- Parallel agent deployment worked well here — 7 sources captured simultaneously, then synthesis written once all completed
- The synthesis file is more valuable than individual captures — it creates connective tissue across sources

## Changes Made

**Git status shows no uncommitted changes** — the files were created in CoS during the session, then moved to Razzo. The most recent commit (11708ddb, within 2 hours) shows the CoS files before they were moved:

- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/00-synthesis.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/ai-steve-linkedin-profile.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/gtm-ai-podcast-claude-cowork-setup.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/humansplusagents-ai-site.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/roi-association-ai-folio.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/roi-association-atelier.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/roi-association-consultant-book.md`
- `Resources/humans-plus-agents/roi-association-repertoire.md`

These files were moved to [[/Users/jtnt/Documents/Projects/Razzo/Research/humans-plus-agents/]] during the session via bash `mv` command.

Also updated:
- `project-index.md` (part of commit 11708ddb — sync from Clients project)

**Files examined (read-only):**
- All 7 captured research files (to write the synthesis)

## Open Items

- The research has been captured but not yet analyzed for Razzo positioning — what from the 729 canon conflicts with or complements Razzo's service model?
- Should Razzo adopt the "micro-assets" approach (building tools, not just delivering insights)?
- How does the Performance Tax model (5 factors degrading AI output) map to CPF verification workflow?
- The session-capture skill itself needs to be told about Razzo so it knows to check that project folder when determining where work belongs
