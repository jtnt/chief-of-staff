# Domain Taste vs. Aesthetic Taste in the AI Age

Conversation started with Jack Cheng's Every article "What Is Taste, Really?" (Feb 6, 2026), which argues that "taste" — the thing everyone says is the competitive moat in the AI era — is actually two distinct concepts that get conflated: (1) personal taste (accumulated preferences through experience) and (2) tastefulness (what's considered "in good taste" by cultural consensus).

The question emerged: does "personal taste" include professional/domain expertise — like knowing what makes a good marketing campaign after 25 years in the field — or is it just aesthetic preference?

## The Expanded Definition

Personal taste, as Cheng frames it, is broad: your accumulated sense of what's good and what isn't, built through exposure and experience. This absolutely includes professional judgment.

**Domain taste** is the pattern recognition you build from doing the work:
- Knowing what a good campaign looks like after seeing hundreds of them
- Spotting weak messaging because you've written and tested enough of it
- Recognizing when a brand position will resonate vs. fall flat
- Understanding what actually performs, not just what looks impressive

Van Lancker's framing (referenced in the article) makes this clear: taste is "a product of friction, earned through making and repeated discernment." That's not furniture selection — that's 25 years of reps in the field. You made campaigns, saw what performed, internalized why. **That is taste.**

## The Tension: Your Taste vs. Consensus Taste

In a professional context, the split between personal taste and tastefulness shows up as:

- **Your domain taste:** "I know from experience this messaging approach works for this audience" (earned through doing)
- **Tastefulness/consensus:** "This campaign won a Cannes Lion" (culturally validated as good)

These overlap heavily but aren't identical. Sometimes your professional taste tells you something consensus hasn't caught up to yet — or that consensus is wrong about. Your edge is in the former, not the latter.

## Why This Matters in the AI Age

If AI can execute the mechanics of a campaign (write copy, design layouts, build landing pages), the person who knows **what good looks like** — from experience, not from copying what won awards — becomes the differentiator.

That's not aesthetic taste. That's domain taste. And it's built the same way: exposure, friction, making, discernment, repetition.

The implication: as AI commoditizes execution, the value concentrates in people who've built deep pattern libraries through doing the work. The question is whether AI can shortcut that accumulation (through synthetic experience or simulation) or whether you still need the reps to develop judgment.

## Open Questions

- Can you accelerate taste development through deliberate exposure without doing the work? (Consuming more campaigns vs. making more campaigns)
- Does AI shift the "reps" from execution to curation/editing? (Prompting and evaluating 50 AI-generated campaigns vs. making 5 manually)
- What's the half-life of domain taste in fast-moving fields? If the game changes every 3 years, does 25 years of experience matter or does recent concentrated exposure matter more?
