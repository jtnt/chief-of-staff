# Awarehouse Marketing Commitment

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Type:** Pro Bono Commitment
**Context:** Weekly Sauna & Cold Plunge Mastermind with Mark Meyerson

---

## The Offer

Offered to help Awarehouse with marketing in April (pro bono).

**Why:**
- Getting free use of their facilities (sauna, cold plunge)
- Fair exchange for the access
- Neither Mark nor his partner have marketing experience
- Seeing opportunities they're not taking advantage of

**Timeline:** April 2026

**Type:** Pro bono marketing consulting/support

## Strategic Notes

This is a relationship-building commitment, not a revenue opportunity. Keep scope manageable - this is about being helpful and maintaining a good relationship, not building a comprehensive marketing program.

Could be good case study material if results are strong, but primary value is the exchange and relationship.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Check in with Mark as April approaches about timeline and priorities
- [ ] Scope initial assessment of current marketing (what they're doing, what they're missing)
- [ ] Define clear boundaries on time commitment (pro bono doesn't mean unlimited)
