Quick wins to try:

- [ ] Add "scrap this and implement the elegant solution" to prompting vocabulary
- [ ] Build habit: "Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again" after corrections
- [ ] Explore `/statusline` customization for context usage tracking
- [ ] Consider building a `/learn` spaced-repetition skill

### 2026-01-30 - Review and implement CoS automation recommendations
**Source:** Two automation analysis sessions on 2026-01-30
**Context:** Identified 5 targeted improvements for Chief of Staff automation stack

**High priority (low effort):**
- [ ] Session start visibility: Choose Option 1 (CLAUDE.md), 2 (notifications), or 3 (pre-script)
- [ ] Notification hook (idle_prompt) - macOS notifications for background work completion
- [ ] Block external edits hook - enforce read-only rule for external project folders

**Medium priority (skills):**
- [ ] `/project-health` skill - on-demand dashboard
- [ ] `/weekly-review` skill - automated weekly synthesis
- [ ] `/cross-project-synthesis` skill - pattern identification across projects
- [ ] `/strategic-decision` skill - formalize decision process
- [ ] `/content-repurpose` skill - multi-platform publishing

**Exploratory:**
- [ ] Verify Linear/Slack MCP servers exist before adding
- [ ] Cross-project synthesizer subagent - background pattern detection
