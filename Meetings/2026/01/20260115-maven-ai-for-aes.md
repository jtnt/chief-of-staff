## One-Line Summary

Jody Geiger and James Kaikis from AI Revenue Studio demonstrate how account executives should approach AI adoption by starting with one high-leverage workflow and building it using their proven prompt formula (Role + Context + Output + Examples + Constraints).

---

## Overview

This was a 21-minute webinar focused on helping account executives move beyond basic AI use (call summaries, follow-up drafts) to building automated workflows that compound over time. The core premise: AI advice is everywhere but inconsistent, and most reps feel unsure how to go from "basic chat" to "real multiplier."

The presenters advocate for workflow-based thinking instead of tool-based thinking. Rather than buying AISDR tools and applying them to existing processes, they recommend deconstructing the buyer journey and sales process, then rebuilding from the ground up with AI-first workflows.

## Key Frameworks & Takeaways

### The Core Problem Statement
- AI advice is everywhere but inconsistent
- Most examples stop at efficiency (call summaries, AI drafts)
- Even top performers feel unsure how to use AI beyond basic chat
- Current AI usage is reactive, disconnected, and doesn't compound
- "I know I need to use AI, I just don't know what good looks like yet"

### Why This Matters Now
- **Gartner stat:** 76% of CROs say sellers need to be reskilled to hit quota
- Buyers are using AI, inboxes are super crowded
- Human touch and human experience is now the differentiation
- "AI isn't automatically improving judgment or prioritization - humans are more important than ever"

### The 4-Part Workflow Framework

**1. Trigger** - What happens that starts the workflow? (e.g., call completes, meeting ends)

**2. Inputs** - What data/assets are available? (e.g., call transcript, CRM context, emails)

**3. AI Action** - What task does AI perform? (summarization or generation)

**4. Output** - What's the end result? (e.g., follow-up email drafted, account brief generated)

### The Prompt Formula

Jody's recommended structure for effective prompts:

1. **Role:** "You're an expert in X" or "You're an AE preparing for discovery"
2. **Context:** Internal knowledge, solution info, deal stage, customer knowledge
3. **Output:** Clear job to be done - "what do you want me to do?"
4. **Examples:** Your work, your language, emails that convert, your style
5. **Constraints:** Character limits, specific rules, formatting requirements

Key insight: "It has to be so clear that anybody, my seven year old son, can follow along with these instructions."

### Example Workflow: Post-Call Follow-Up

- **Trigger:** Call recording completes
- **Input:** Transcript lands in accessible file
- **AI Action:** Analyze transcript for pain points, sentiment, key moments
- **Output:** Follow-up email drafted and waiting in inbox for review

Instead of 3-4 hours of manual research and prep, AI handles the heavy lifting in 30 minutes of review/adjustment.

### Getting Started Advice

**Pick ONE high-leverage workflow:**
- Happens often (daily or multiple times per day)
- High impact (influences deal quality)
- Requires real thinking today

**Start small:**
- Don't boil the ocean
- Build the habit before adding complexity
- Don't tackle three workflows at once
- Iterate like you tweak messaging

**Maturity path:**
1. Start with manual prompts
2. Create a project or GPT for it
3. Use automation tools to grab files automatically

## Notable Quotes

**On workflow-based thinking:**
> "What I saw was not people toggling together tools to get an output, but was rethinking their workflows, rethinking the jobs to be done... really making crazy efficiency gains in terms of how they re approach their work versus saying hey, I'm going to get the AISDR tool and apply it to my business."
> — James Kaikis

**On the human factor:**
> "AI isn't automatically improving judgment or prioritization. This really, in my opinion, is why humans are more important than ever, right? Because the human touch and the human experience is now really where the differentiation is."
> — James Kaikis

**On making time for what matters:**
> "When do you have time in your day to hang out with your family, work out, touch a tree? Like, those are all the things that matter. And I think with AI this is what allows us to find that time and make sure that we're still operating at the height of our game."
> — Jody Geiger

**On prompt clarity:**
> "Anything that a brand new intern or your 14 year old cousin can't understand - that's not going to work. It has to be so clear that anybody, my seven year old son, can follow along with these instructions."
> — Jody Geiger

## How This Applies to Razzo

**Directly relevant insights:**

1. **The core pain point is validated:** "I know I need to use AI, I just don't know what good looks like yet" - this is the exact problem Razzo solves for sales/marketing teams.

2. **Workflow-based > tool-based:** This confirms our sprint-first approach. Instead of "here's a tool, go use it," we're teaching people to deconstruct and rebuild their workflows with AI-first thinking.

3. **The prompt formula is teachable:** Jody's 5-part formula (Role + Context + Output + Examples + Constraints) is concrete and practical. This could be integrated into Razzo sprint curriculum.

4. **Start small, build habits:** The "one high-leverage workflow" approach aligns perfectly with a sprint model - pick one workflow, spend a week building/iterating it, then move to the next.

5. **Real deals, real data:** They emphasize using "your live deals and your own data" in their Revenue Drivers workshop. This validates hands-on, practical training vs theoretical AI education.

**Competitive positioning:**

AI Revenue Studio offers monthly "Revenue Drivers" workshops where participants work on live deals and get feedback. This is similar to Razzo's sprint model but appears to be cohort-based training rather than embedded team sprints.

**Potential content opportunities:**

- The 4-part workflow framework could become a Razzo content piece
- "How to write prompts your 7-year-old could follow" as a writing/teaching principle
- Case study format: "From 3 hours to 30 minutes: Automating account research"
- The maturity path (manual → GPT → automation) as a progression model

**Teaching approach:**

The "make it so clear a 7-year-old could follow" principle is powerful for training. If we're teaching teams to build AI workflows, the instructions need to be that clear - both for the AI and for the team members learning to use it.
