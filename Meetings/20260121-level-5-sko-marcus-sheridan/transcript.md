[2026-01-21T18:01:11.815Z]
All right, let's make sure everyone's muted. We're about to get started. Welcome.

[2026-01-21T18:01:15.655Z]
You know, it's, it's, it's. It's always fun what you hear on audio when people don't know that they are not yet muted. So make sure you're muted. We're going to have a great time, a great conversation today. If you don't know me, my name is Marcus Sheridan, and I'm going to be joined by my chief of staff, Becca, today, who is Becca. The baller is what I call her because she's so great, and she's going to be helping me to manage this conversation that we're going to be having. Go ahead and put in the chat, you know, like the deals, like put. Tell us. Tell us who you are, where you're from. I think that's actually fun. This is going to be a great experience for you. That's my personal promise. You're going to get some takeaways. I think you're going to think about. Your, Your sales communication, probably your. Your personal communication in a different way than you thought before. I told you before this as a promise that there wasn't going to be like, like some, like, offer or anything like that. No, this is all just a gift today and to give because I want you to have an incredible 20. 26. And whether you're a solopreneur, whether you're B2B or B2C, whatever you are, I promise today, if you've got the right headspace, and that's going to be the key, of course you're going to have recording in progress, so that's my. That's my promise to you. So we've got folks coming in from so far, at least three countries that I see. We've got uk, we've got Canada, we got the us wow. We got New Zealand in the house. I'm not sure what time it is in New Zealand, but Jackie. Thank you for joining us. You can let us know what time it is there. And Austria. Renee, so good to see you.

[2026-01-21T18:02:48.935Z]
You know, I know many of you might know me for they ask, you answer. But one of the great passions of my life really is communication. And the through line to anything I'm a part of is how to communicate in such a way to win trust. And if you look at what marketing is, marketing is just communicating. To the masses to win trust. If you look at what sales is, that's communicating to a smaller group to win trust and ultimately win their business. If you look at leadership, that's communicating to a team so as to win more trust and to move things across the finish line. All right, so today I want to start. I know some of you appreciate 80s movies, and if you've ever seen me speak before, you might have seen this, this little analogy. But anybody remember. And don't say it out loud, of course, but does anybody remember the movie and the scene here? If you're an 80s movies buff like me, you probably Remember this? Yeah. This is Karate Kid. This is wax on, wax off. You've got Daniel and you've got Miyagi. Raise your hand if you've seen this movie more than once. Raise your hand if you've seen this movie more than once. For all of you that haven't seen it. At least one time you missed out on something really special. Okay, now, why am I showing you this? I'm showing you this because.

[2026-01-21T18:04:04.215Z]
We're going to be talking about sales today in a different way than. Than you may have, like, received training in the past. Maybe this won't be atypical for you, but for a lot of people, this will be atypical. If you look where Daniel was in this moment, he was being asked to do something by Miyagi. And he was super annoyed. It was like, what the heck is this crazy old man asking me to do? And I'm getting frustrated, and he's getting me just to, like, do work on his house and his cars and his fences, and all I really want to do is learn karate. But Miyagi understood something that a lot of sales trainers don't understand a lot of CEOs to understand. Unless you build extraordinary foundations for your skills there, it doesn't translate to to the mat, or in this case, to to that sales call that is so important to you. But if you can make sure.

[2026-01-21T18:04:58.055Z]
That you are, are able to carry these things over, then you're going to have. You're going to have serious magic. And so my point to you is this. Make sure today as we're doing this, that you have have some patience, just like Daniel had to have patience and suddenly understood why he was being. Asked to do what he was being asked to do.

[2026-01-21T18:05:22.455Z]
I'm going to ask that you have this as well. So just make sure. Sure. Make sure that you're able to have that patience again. Make sure you're muted if you're listening to this right now. It's really important because we want to make this interactive, but you've got to be. It's really important. You've got to be muted for everybody else. Okay. So point is, I want you to lean in.

[2026-01-21T18:05:43.975Z]
I want you to make sure you're really embracing the activities that we do. We're going to have some activities. I want you to allow yourself to grow, all right? And this also means I'm going to need you to make sure that you are willing to engage with me.

[2026-01-21T18:06:04.295Z]
On occasion. So if you're willing to engage with me, I would really appreciate it. I'm going to have Becca sometimes, like, call on somebody, and then hopefully, if you're up for it, you'll be able to. You'll be able to join in. We'll do some activities. Now, hopefully, you've. Already gotten your workbook that was also in the meeting invite. The workbook is essential to the value that you're going to receive today. So I'm going to ask everyone to pull out your workbook and have it open on another screen. And if you can print it out, go ahead and print it out this workbook. We're not going to do every page of it together. Because ideally, what you're going to do after we go through this is you're going to be able to. You're going to be able to practice a lot of the stuff that we talk about after this call and those that get the most from it are going to do just that. That being said, I am going to walk you through some of those workbook pages as we're doing this together. And so please, for the love of all it's pure and holy, make sure you follow along, because I want you to get from this. If you're. If you're half here right now, it's going to be really, really difficult for you to get from this. If you're putting your phone upside down or if you have it in the other room and it's like there's no, There's. You can't. Hear it. You're going to get so much more from this.

[2026-01-21T18:07:29.015Z]
And if you do not have, eventually we're going to do the workbooks in a way that you can just, like, type on the screen. But for now, I want you to write it out on a regular sheet of paper. If you write this out versus type it out, it's going to be more effective if you type it out versus not doing anything at all but just thinking about it in your head.

[2026-01-21T18:07:47.895Z]
You know, that's going to be better than just thinking it out. So please don't think it out. As we do these exercises, make sure you write it out, and preferably you're writing it with pen on some type of. On some type of note pat or something like that that you have, all right? Good.

[2026-01-21T18:08:04.615Z]
Hey, Marcus, before we kick off, too, one thing if y'all. Since we're going to be interactive, there's three little dots on the top. On the top right corner. If you could just rename yourself to your first and last name. So that way when we're able to call out and interact with you. We know what your first and last name is.

[2026-01-21T18:08:20.215Z]
Yeah, yeah, you just. It. Just click on rename and you can correct your date there. Many of you already have that in place, so thank you for that.

[2026-01-21T18:08:27.895Z]
All right, now, kind of, I want you to put this in chat. And by the way, you can. You can ask questions in chat today, but how many here can say that you have an extraordinary sales training culture in your company right now? Now, if you're a solopreneur,

[2026-01-21T18:08:42.695Z]
That would mean that you have an extraordinary sales learning and training culture by yourself. But you can absolutely have that as a solopreneur. So anybody should be able to answer this. And so I want you to do like a very honest yes or no. You can't have both in the chat. All right. Just a very, very honest. Yes or no?

[2026-01-21T18:08:59.975Z]
Do you have an extraordinary sales training culture?

[2026-01-21T18:09:04.935Z]
In your company now you might say. Well, I'm not really sure.

[2026-01-21T18:09:08.055Z]
Choose one. Just. Just choose one. And I think you'll be able to reflect on this as we go forward with this conversation today.

[2026-01-21T18:09:16.375Z]
So let's just say, well, like, looking at the numbers we've got, probably for the most part, I would say it's probably 80. 20. 80, 20. Yeah. I would say 80% of us say, no, I don't have an extraordinary sales training culture right now, okay?

[2026-01-21T18:09:33.655Z]
So let's analyze this and let's talk about just really briefly, because I want to. I don't want to spend my time with the. With the issues that we see.

[2026-01-21T18:09:40.455Z]
I want to spend more time working with you, on you individually. And so that's going to be the high majority. But just a couple minutes on this, and then we're going to really start to get into the meat. So here's the problems that we see in the context of this is, you know, I'VE been speaking around the world for 15 years to many, many organizations, oftentimes speaking to sales teams, speaking to sales leaders, speaking to CEOs. And today we have, of course, a sales and leadership training company called Question First Group. We got a bunch of clients here, too. And so the context of this is from all of these events, all the questions I've asked, all the polls I've done. So here's what. Here's what we see again and again now when it comes to sales kickoffs. Now, you can apply this, by the way, to sales meetings, but let's. Let's talk about sales kickoff. SKOS for a second, a sales kickoff. This, of course, is January, and it's one of the big reasons why we're doing this is because we want you to feel like you've got a big jolt to the beginning of your year, just really changing your state in terms of the way that you're selling right now. Some of you had some really cool comments about how you wanted to change your selling. Most SKOs, most sales kickoffs and sales like trainings in general are treated not as they're treated, more like an event and not as a behavior change campaign. And I hope by the end of this, you're going to see the difference because we're not here for pomp and circumstance. What we don't want is. We don't want a bunch of, like, rah, rah. What we want is to. Is to generate an energy within this group here where we're saying, I want to change some. Of the behavior that I have demonstrated on my sales calls in the past and my sales conversations in the past. All right. So that's what we have to learn how to do. This is all about behavior change. And if you and your organization are doing sales trainings, we want to make sure that we go away from like this event. Mindset number two.

[2026-01-21T18:11:41.175Z]
Most sales kickoffs.

[2026-01-21T18:11:43.415Z]
Over index on inspiration and under invest and practice and coaching. So you're going to see here and I want you to look at this conversation that we have today. Once we get past this initial just intro so we're setting the conditions together.

[2026-01-21T18:11:58.695Z]
What you're going to see here is that we're going to spend our time coaching and practicing. We do not see this with most companies. So I'm going to ask that that you really start to, when you think about your sales trainings, say, are we spinning the majority of our time practicing and coaching? If it's not at least 80%, you're off track within your organization. Most companies have sales meetings, but not sales trainings. So we very much want to change that. All right. So that's the second problem with sales kickoffs. Thirds issue that we see again and again is most sales kickoffs and sales trainings in general attempt to cover too much.

[2026-01-21T18:12:41.735Z]
What this does. It creates a cognitive overload. Today. I am not going to overload you. I have made this mistake many times. I mean, as a speaker, I. You know, you try to put ten pounds of stuff in a five pound bag and it just doesn't work, so we're not going to do that. Today we're going to really lean into two fundamental skills that if you learn these two skills, it's going to change your life. That's my promise to you. That's where we're going to spend the majority of our time today. So when you're doing great sales trainings in the future. Make sure that you are. Make sure that you're not having or suffering from this cognitive overload, all right?

[2026-01-21T18:13:22.695Z]
Less than 3% of sales teams have actual sales training at least once a week.

[2026-01-21T18:13:30.935Z]
All right, So I want. I want to do this again real quick. And just give me a yes or no. If you have sales training, at least once a week, if you have sales training at least once a week, at least once a week.

[2026-01-21T18:13:48.535Z]
I want you to go ahead and say, yes, we have sales training at least once a week. No, we don't in the chat. And what I mean by that is, remember, this is not a sales meeting. This is sales training. All right? So that's what we're looking. That's what we're looking for, so let us know.

[2026-01-21T18:14:10.295Z]
And what we see is, of course, the majority of companies are not. So let's just look at. Let's look at what we're seeing across the board right now with the answers that you're giving.

[2026-01-21T18:14:20.535Z]
This is really problematic situation that we see.

[2026-01-21T18:14:24.695Z]
Because what it leads to is we are practicing selling on our customers.

[2026-01-21T18:14:31.735Z]
That's what the big problem is. We're practicing selling on our customers.

[2026-01-21T18:14:35.815Z]
And we need to start.

[2026-01-21T18:14:38.295Z]
Practicing instead on ourselves. That's one of the big challenges that I want to give you in this conversation today is that you say as an organization, again, whether you're one or many, we don't practice selling on our customers anymore.

[2026-01-21T18:14:52.455Z]
We practice on ourselves.

[2026-01-21T18:14:54.935Z]
That's who we are. That's how we roll. Now we're getting ready to get into the workbook.

[2026-01-21T18:15:02.295Z]
As a preface to this, and we actually look for this when we're helping companies hire sales people. What we find is the one fundamental, critical skill for someone to become great at sales. You know, whether they've been in the game five years, 20 years, doesn't matter, is they've got to have self. Awareness. They've got to have this ability to look at the coin, both sides, and see very clearly. Here's the things that I'm. I'm. I'm doing poorly. Here's the things that I'm doing well. Here's the stuff that I need to work on. But remember, you. Need to be able to see both sides. You want to see? Honestly, here's what I'm doing. Well.

[2026-01-21T18:15:37.495Z]
You don't want to just badger yourself all the time. Say, I'm not doing these things. I'm so bad at these things. Notice what you do well. The gray ones see what they do well, and at the same time, the great ones notice the things that they're not doing well. All right, so. I want to make sure that you are aligned with this. All right, now.

[2026-01-21T18:15:58.135Z]
I want you to pull out your workbook and let's go to the check in page. I want you to do this with me as we're doing this now. If somebody is willing to volunteer.

[2026-01-21T18:16:07.015Z]
I want you to just raise your hand and Becca is going to call on you, and I'm just going to walk you through this individually as everyone else walks through this as a group. So someone's willing to volunteer. Let give me just one brave person that's awesome. That wants to. He won't. Embarrass you. I promise I'm not going to embarrass you. But I just want to do this with you right now as an individual. And listen, as I said earlier, if you don't write this down as we're doing this, you're not going to get as much from. This. One of the biggest issues that we see with sales trainings, sales kickoffs, is there is not a place for self reflection.

[2026-01-21T18:16:46.775Z]
And personal honesty.

[2026-01-21T18:16:48.775Z]
And so I want to make sure that we are able to do that right now. And this is why you have this workbook. It's so powerful. So who's one volunteer? And Becca, you can call on somebody. I'm going to call on someone. Raises.

[2026-01-21T18:17:02.855Z]
Ready, johnny holston. All right, j. Come.

[2026-01-21T18:17:08.055Z]
All right, johnny.

[2026-01-21T18:17:09.095Z]
Hey, Marcus. How you doing, buddy? I'm good. How are you, brother? Good, man. Good to talk to you. All right, so let's just go through this together real quick. If you had to say, Johnny, your. Your single biggest communication sales communication challenge right now, again, be as self aware in as specific as possible. What would you say it is?

[2026-01-21T18:17:30.695Z]
Got to choose one.

[2026-01-21T18:17:35.495Z]
I think the biggest thing for me.

[2026-01-21T18:17:39.575Z]
If I look honestly at my last 10 at, let's say the last 10 at bats, I have a real tendency. I'm guessing I can't be the only one. I look at products and I look at how can we package an engagement? And I'm thinking that way a little too early. And so. Sometimes I might, like, check out when a customer is opening up on pain points and going deep on that. And so, like, I asked the right questions, they say the right things, but even as they're talking in my head, I'm like, all right, how might we do X, Y, Z? So I was almost like a lack of a lack of engagement and presence during important discovery. You nailed it with that last a lack of strong presence during discovery. By the way, does everybody notice that he hesitated at first? He reflected, and then he said something that was really, really profound and very, very aware. So, so good on that. All right, so let's keep going with this because that was. That was really excellent. Now, you mentioned when this shows up. All right, it shows up when you're doing discovery. Is there a time you notice when it shows up? More or less. You know, like, is there a particular type of client? Is a particular situation when you notice yourself moving forward? Too quickly and not staying with that discovery.

[2026-01-21T18:18:56.615Z]
I think it's typically when we get and this is helpful to think through when we get someone that's maybe not quite bullseye, qualified lead. Yes. Great. Great. So when we feel this person might not be a great fit and you, because you've been in the game for a while, you sense that pretty early. Right. Just like anybody that's been in the game for a while can start to sense that pretty early. Yeah. Because of that, we tend to speed up the discovery process, which, of course, makes it even more likely that the person isn't going to be a good fit, which I'm jumping a little bit. To number three. So let's you talk about that now, because you do that sometimes. What's the impact that it has on your deals?

[2026-01-21T18:19:40.535Z]
Well, either we'll. We'll try to, like, force force some sort of project for someone that's not a good fit. Or like you said, we check out during important information, which then makes it even harder to create said project that actually solves a pain point. So I think it slows things down and. It muddies the water. It muddies the water for our buyers and for us as much as as so smart slows it down, muddies the water. And I would also add, it creates oftentimes a sense of disconnect or distrust. And maybe they they feel good about you, but it's not as high as it could be had we gone that full extent of discovery. Now, what we just did, that was great, by the way. Everybody getting a little round of applause on the screen. Good job. That was great. That was self awareness. And that is a beautiful example of when you start to force yourself to address some of these questions. Specifically, you start to create breakthroughs that you normally wouldn't have. The problem is many of us live in a world where it's like phone, and I'm just going through everything really, really fast, and I'm not reflecting deep enough on where I am in terms of how I'm communicating. I want you to get to a point where in the future, you're so self aware about your communication deficiencies and strengths that if anybody asks you what's your biggest sales communication challenge right now?

[2026-01-21T18:21:02.455Z]
Boom. You can just nail it in a second. That's where you want to be. All right, so that was the. That was the. That. That was a great start. And what I want you to do is I want you to continue. You don't have to do this right now, but I want you to continue to. Work on this. A couple other really important questions you can see on your, on your within your workbook.

[2026-01-21T18:21:27.015Z]
My hardest moment on sales calls.

[2026-01-21T18:21:30.695Z]
If I asked you for each one of the sales people you have on your team, and some of you have many, some of you have none, but if I said, what are the hardest moments on sales calls for that person, that person, that person, that person, would you know? Because you should know.

[2026-01-21T18:21:44.615Z]
And we want to know what they think it is as well, because oftentimes your answer isn't what their answer is. And the one thing I want to be better at.

[2026-01-21T18:21:55.735Z]
Do you know that for each one of your sales people? Do you know that for yourself? Do you know that for your managers? If you don't know that from a communication standpoint, you're missing something there because the development that you're going to have with your team is going to be limited. Take the time to do this like we did it and really push yourself and do this with your team. If you do this with your team, it's going to be an incredible, effective activity. You could have a sales kickoff.

[2026-01-21T18:22:23.895Z]
With your team or sales meeting this month, and all you did was discuss these questions, these eight ones as a team. And it will be probably one of the best sales meetings you'll have all year, full stop.

[2026-01-21T18:22:35.895Z]
If you do that. So I would challenge everyone here to have that conversation with someone on your team and not just do it with yourself. And if you're a solopreneur, do it with a partner, spouse, loved one, whatever you got to do so that you're verbalizing it and talking out because it's a big time game changer. All right. Really, really great job. Now, as we're teaching these two fundamental techniques today that we're going to lean into together, I just want to talk about something that we see a lot of which is in the world of sales and sales training, when it comes to communication, people oftentimes will say, that doesn't feel natural. That doesn't feel scripted. That's not who I am.

[2026-01-21T18:23:21.255Z]
And this general mindset is a progress killer and a skill killer for you if you want to become very, very proficient.

[2026-01-21T18:23:32.775Z]
You must understand that we have got to crawl before we walk, and we've got to walk before we run. When it comes to the way that we are going to learn stuff,

[2026-01-21T18:23:45.655Z]
And the stuff that I'm going to show you today is probably, unless you've been working on it for a while, don't you feel unnatural? And at first it might feel scripted. The idea, though, is that you get to a place from you go from a place of student to mastery. So let's just look at the, like, let's look at the phases that you've got to have. And this is what we really try to instill in anybody that we're training. Question first group. Because if they don't have this mentality going in, they're going to stop short because they're going to say it just didn't work for me.

[2026-01-21T18:24:19.975Z]
Do not be that person, number one. You got to be really dang curious. Got to have this mindset of, you know what? I might have been in this game for a while, but I. I still got stuff to learn, and I'm ready to learn.

[2026-01-21T18:24:31.495Z]
Then you have the concepts that are presented to you.

[2026-01-21T18:24:35.095Z]
And ideally, they're presented to you in a clear structure. And today that's my job, to show you something in a clear structure. Now, the first step, and you shouldn't allow this to bother you, is to copy it exactly as you see it.

[2026-01-21T18:24:49.895Z]
So yes, at first it feels like a script.

[2026-01-21T18:24:53.735Z]
The whole purpose, though, is that you go from copying so that you get that clear competence.

[2026-01-21T18:25:02.215Z]
To where it now allows you to break free from said script to become more yours.

[2026-01-21T18:25:11.335Z]
But people try to skip that and they don't follow it from. From a script perspective oftentimes, and then they just fail to actually get it.

[2026-01-21T18:25:24.615Z]
Once you get it, the comprehension is there, you understand the principle, you understand how it works, and you can start to really apply it in any scenario. So the idea here is we're not trying to teach you what to say, we're trying to teach you how to think. But if you learn some parameters of what to say first, then you can start to think very differently on the fly when you communicate and people start to say, how did you learn, like, to think like that on the fly? Because you understood a foundation at the beginning. So once that happens, you've got the comprehension, then you start to customize. You really make it. Your own, but you still hold fast to the core. Principles. You don't let go of the principles.

[2026-01-21T18:26:05.415Z]
And say, well, that one really wasn't important. I'm going to skip that one. No, that causes failure. So you stick with the principles, but you put your personality, your flair, your style, whatever that is.

[2026-01-21T18:26:17.975Z]
And now you start to do it.

[2026-01-21T18:26:19.895Z]
And you do it a lot. You do it more and more until it becomes automatic. Until people look at you like. I mean, how do you like? It's like you're breathing. Yeah, but you've done it a thousand times.

[2026-01-21T18:26:30.695Z]
That's anything that I show you today.

[2026-01-21T18:26:33.575Z]
Anything that you learned from. From us. I can promise you can be as natural as breathing. I really mean that. So do not label yourself as one. That's. I just don't think I could ever do that. We've seen it too many times where somebody said, that's not my thing. That's. Unnatural. It became their thing.

[2026-01-21T18:26:50.215Z]
Now the key though, is you go from doing it often in the reps to starting to teach it. And once you start to teach it, forget about it. Now you become a dang ninja and you become the Mr. Miyagi or Mrs. Miyagi, right? You become that person that is ready to be the sensei and that's mastery. That's what we're going after. But give yourself the grace to go through all the phases before that and to also be patient enough to say, okay, at first, yeah, this won't be exactly me, but I'm gonna work through it enough so that it does become me. And who I am. Ok? That was one foundational element we had to talk about. Second foundational element.

[2026-01-21T18:27:31.175Z]
Is what we call real role plays, and this is incredibly important.

[2026-01-21T18:27:35.655Z]
Oftentimes when we go into organizations and we ask teams about role plays, people roll their eyes immediately. Why do they roll their eyes immediately? Because they're not doing what we call real role plays, and they're not treating them as real role plays. I can tell you this. The attitude that a team or an individual has towards role playing is purely consistent with two things either a who has their current sales leader in their company or b who were their previous sales leaders.

[2026-01-21T18:28:08.535Z]
If you're now by yourself because if you work with me in the past, I can promise you you would say role plays are stinking amazing. They are life changing for those that treat them with a serious nature, like Jonathan Christian, a friend of mine who's on this right now. He has done role plays with me before, right? He gets it. He understands.

[2026-01-21T18:28:31.415Z]
Role plays will change lives for those that treat him as real. That's why we call them real. So what does that like, what are the rules of real role plays? And I would suggest that you implement this within your organization. This is very, very important.

[2026-01-21T18:28:46.935Z]
Don't wait to be picked. Volunteer.

[2026-01-21T18:28:50.535Z]
Treat it as a real conversation. In other words, the stakes are high. It's exactly as if I was talking to the most important client in the world right now.

[2026-01-21T18:28:58.855Z]
You want to get into character immediately. You do not have any fluff, period. We do have any waste. And you stay in character even when it becomes uncomfortable, you sudden start cracking up. Unless you would crack up in real life, like as a real customer.

[2026-01-21T18:29:15.735Z]
We always try to show and not just tell. We maximize reps and we minimize discussion.

[2026-01-21T18:29:24.535Z]
Respect the room, which is very important. You want to add energy to the room, and you want to help each other win. That's your job. Job is not to roll over. Job's not to be super easy or super hard. If you're the person that's acting as the customer, your job is to help elevate everyone in that room in that moment. That's my commitment to you. If, like, I did a role play with you today, that's exactly what we're going to do.

[2026-01-21T18:29:48.455Z]
We're going to make sure we've got that. We've got that mindset, okay? So if you start to embrace real world plays in your company, within your sales kickoffs, within your sales trainings, it's going to change your life. But this is something that starts with leadership. It starts with leadership. Okay, so let's just get into the first core principle that I want to teach you today. This is called the Honest Agreement. And some of you may have heard me talk about this before, but I really want you to lean into this with me because it is absolutely powerful. It will change your life. It'll change. Your sales conversations. It'll change your leadership conversations, especially your one to ones. It will change your personal conversations, the ones that are very important. It'll set a very different tone, a tone where you start to engender trust faster than you've ever created it in your life. And you're saying, wow. How did that happen? Now, what is the definition of the honest agreement? The honest agreement is a mutual. You can find this in your workbook, so follow along. So jump. Jump to that section of your workbook now.

[2026-01-21T18:30:52.375Z]
It's a mutual commitment.

[2026-01-21T18:30:53.655Z]
About how a conversation will be handled so both parties can be honest, direct, and challenge each other while making clear decisions without defensiveness or hidden resistance. And hidden resistance is the big fat one that kills deals. All right, so we're going to get into the honest agreement. To understand the honest agreement, you must start with root. Cause, like, why is it important?

[2026-01-21T18:31:21.895Z]
Now, I want everyone to turn to this page. Because if you understand, if you master the honest agreement, you will solve the problem. And this is the problem that many of you have on your calls. And it's driving you bananas because you think you've got a deal closed, you think you've got an op. That's ready to rock and roll. And you're like, why did they ghost me?

[2026-01-21T18:31:46.215Z]
So I want you to think back and let's go ahead and answer this in chat, if you would be so awesome.

[2026-01-21T18:31:53.255Z]
As to help the group think back over the last six to 12 months.

[2026-01-21T18:31:57.255Z]
How many times did you or somebody on your sales team believe that you had a good fit?

[2026-01-21T18:32:03.735Z]
You had a strong conversation.

[2026-01-21T18:32:06.535Z]
You had a clear solution.

[2026-01-21T18:32:08.455Z]
There was genuine interest and they ghosted you.

[2026-01-21T18:32:11.655Z]
Okay?

[2026-01-21T18:32:13.015Z]
How many times has this happened to you over the last six to 12 months? And let's just look at some of the answers on the screen, everyone.

[2026-01-21T18:32:24.615Z]
You've got regularly 20 times too often to count a few times consistently. All right. Several times. If you Times several. This is when we look at sales conversations and sales recordings over and over again. This is an absolute killer. It's like that, perplexing. It's like, I don't understand why did suddenly they ghost me, ok?

[2026-01-21T18:32:47.735Z]
Well, we get ghosted because people.

[2026-01-21T18:32:55.735Z]
They like us.

[2026-01-21T18:32:58.055Z]
But they can't be honest with us.

[2026-01-21T18:33:00.935Z]
And we're going to get into this.

[2026-01-21T18:33:02.695Z]
So what did they say? Let's call on someone. I want somebody to join me here. Beck, who do we got here? I just want to walk somebody through this. Let's see.

[2026-01-21T18:33:12.535Z]
Jesse and Tom, I think. Jesse, you might be right in front. What you got? All right. Jesse or Tom? All right, so good. Unmute yourself if you can.

[2026-01-21T18:33:23.895Z]
Can you hear us? Yeah, I can hear you, Jess. You sound great. All right, so. So how many times over the last 6 to 12 months has this happened for you all or someone in your organization?

[2026-01-21T18:33:34.295Z]
Oh, we've got.

[2026-01-21T18:33:35.655Z]
Four salespeople that are at Rayleigh, so I'm confident it happens quite often. Yeah, it's. It's happening all the time. Okay, what are the phrases that you're fine buyers use?

[2026-01-21T18:33:49.575Z]
That is that that that phrase that caps off that initial conversation and leach the break? In other words, an example of this would be, all right, everything sounds great. We'll get back to you pretty soon and we'll let you know. Ok, so let's just assume that's one, but what are some other phrases that they're saying to your salespeople that would indicate they just quote, need a little more time. Which is also another phrase that I'm sure many of them have heard. What are some other ones?

[2026-01-21T18:34:19.495Z]
Typically, you get the. Don't want to check with another Another. Get another quote is. Okay, good. All right. That's a great one. Yeah. We just want to we, we want to make sure we do our due diligence. We're going to check with we're going to make sure we get another quote. That's a good one. Got another one there, Tom. Jesse, I think I've heard the sales guy say multiple times, like, I need to check with my husband or one of the spouses isn't on board. Right. So we've got to check with the other decision maker or decision makers that's a really classic one right now. This is one of those where there's lots of ways that, you know, we, you know, there's lots of things that we can hear.

[2026-01-21T18:34:56.375Z]
And I would ask. And by the way, you can, you can, you can, you can mute yourself. Again, Jesse and Tom, thank you for, for your answers here. That was great. We got you.

[2026-01-21T18:35:07.095Z]
What happens all the times after these conversations, right? You see that there's sometimes slow responses. You might get canceled meetings. You might just get dead on silence. Like, where'd they go? Like, did they die? Like, what is going on here? So you want to make sure that your salespeople fill this in.

[2026-01-21T18:35:24.055Z]
They actually fill this in? Because each one indicates something different possibly is going on here. And then, looking back, where did the clarity not exist?

[2026-01-21T18:35:33.335Z]
So did we know just how important this thing was to them? One of the biggest issues that we see, especially in B2B selling, but it happens, B2C as well, is that the salesperson never defines how important solving this problem is versus all the other problems the person is having or the company's having. In their life right now.

[2026-01-21T18:35:54.135Z]
Declarity not exist.

[2026-01-21T18:35:55.895Z]
In terms of where the was the prospect not willing to be direct and, you know, was, you know, what was missing, what clarity did not exist. So what I want you to put down, or I want you to, your salesperson to put down, is essentially, if you're being very honest and very self aware, ghosting happens. Most often for you. When? What?

[2026-01-21T18:36:21.495Z]
Now I would make the argument primarily it's because they do not feel comfortable enough to tell you what they're really thinking.

[2026-01-21T18:36:33.495Z]
Another way to put that is they don't want to tell you your baby's ugly.

[2026-01-21T18:36:38.055Z]
And listen, if you have a baby right now. I have a grandbaby, by the way.

[2026-01-21T18:36:45.175Z]
There's no such thing as an ugly baby. Thank you, Becca. There's no such thing as ugly baby. But in terms of the world of sales, there is.

[2026-01-21T18:36:53.175Z]
Your product, your solution.

[2026-01-21T18:36:55.495Z]
Is oftentimes without you knowing it, ugly in the eyes of the buyer. And I say ugly. Something about it is off. Something about it concerns them. You, your product, your solution, the issue is because they like you.

[2026-01-21T18:37:09.575Z]
They are not telling you this, and you have not given them permission. You say, yes, I have. I. I told them to be honest with me. No, it doesn't work like that. You've got to go through a much more thorough process. And this is what we call the honest agreement. And the honest agreement.

[2026-01-21T18:37:27.095Z]
It takes five. It includes five essential steps.

[2026-01-21T18:37:32.615Z]
And here are the five steps. The first thing we do in step one is and again, follow along. The workbook here, follow along is we raise the stakes of the conversation. In other words, we help the person realize this is a big deal, this conversation, this decision, you know, this new thing, whatever it is. It's a big deal. We do not want to make any mistakes. We raise the stakes. Once we've raised the stakes, we have number two, which is when we promise to them that we are going to be honest, that we're going to be candid and we're going to hold nothing back. By the way, I'M going to do this live in just a minute.

[2026-01-21T18:38:04.455Z]
With some of you. All right? You're not. I'm not going to ask you to do it. Don't worry. I'm going to put myself on the pressure. And I want you to grade yourself out to see how well you're doing this in your sales team is doing this. And you might have seen me teach this before, and you're still not doing it the way they should be doing. I have seen many folks tell me I'm doing it. We watch them on these calls, and they're definitively missing one or two of these steps. Now, once you tell them your commitment to be honest,

[2026-01-21T18:38:31.175Z]
You get a confirmation?

[2026-01-21T18:38:32.535Z]
That they agree with that.

[2026-01-21T18:38:35.815Z]
Step number three is we're going to set expectations, normally in the form of telling them we're going to ask you questions that no one has asked you before, and you need to push through those questions with me. You might also talk about some other expectations, but primarily you're going to let them know that you are asking them questions that are atypical because you're what we call a Pathfinder. You go deeper. You're more challenging. You discover things that no one else discovers.

[2026-01-21T18:39:04.535Z]
But you have to preview that, because otherwise they might say, geez, why ask me that? So we get in front of it. It's called vanguarding.

[2026-01-21T18:39:14.455Z]
Once we have let them know.

[2026-01-21T18:39:16.455Z]
We're going to ask deep questions, and once again, we've confirmed that they're good with that.

[2026-01-21T18:39:21.335Z]
We're now going to get their commitment.

[2026-01-21T18:39:23.175Z]
And what is their commitment?

[2026-01-21T18:39:25.575Z]
Their commitment is to let us know at any point if the baby's ugly.

[2026-01-21T18:39:29.895Z]
If they don't like the thing, if they don't agree with the thing, we literally role play with them. And I'm serious about this.

[2026-01-21T18:39:37.895Z]
What they need to say if they don't like something.

[2026-01-21T18:39:41.975Z]
If they've not practiced telling you they don't like the thing, there's a very good chance they won't tell you later. And that's when you get ghosted and you're wondering, I don't understand. We have the perfect solution.

[2026-01-21T18:39:52.855Z]
And then finally they agree to it verbally. They say to you? Yes.

[2026-01-21T18:39:58.455Z]
I promise to be open and honest and transparent with you always. Okay, now you're saying to yourself, this sounds weird. I want to see what it looks like. First of all, if it sounds weird, that's good, because this means you're learning something new and something different. It's going to be something. It's going to be challenging to you. So I'm going to just pull somebody out here back us. So let's just pull somebody from the group. Yeah, I got someone. Jamie Miller. She's been really engaging. Smiling, laughing. Jamie Miller, you're so dang awesome. Jamie Miller.

[2026-01-21T18:40:25.975Z]
All right.

[2026-01-21T18:40:27.575Z]
Jamie, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for hosting this. All right, well, thank you for just being gracious. I care about people, and I care about you, and I really want people to say, wow, this was. This was different. So, Jamie, what is it that you sell?

[2026-01-21T18:40:45.495Z]
So I work for a boat dealership, and it's all boats, but my job is to sell the appointment to come see the boat. All right? And you sell the appointment. Okay. You sell the appointment.

[2026-01-21T18:40:56.295Z]
All right. So let's just do it. Let's just do it from a dealership perspective so everybody can see this. And by the way, this could be done from an appointment perspective as well. There's a couple different ways to do this. Let's start this. If I was a salesperson and you walked into the showroom. What would this look like? All right. And so I'm going to show everyone the steps to this, Jamie. And then let's just talk. And you probably have heard me talk about this before. A little bit. But I want you to just discuss. I want you to be thinking about what's different about the way that you all, as a dealership, have always done it.

[2026-01-21T18:41:30.295Z]
Versus looking at this method, and if anybody's applied it, maybe you can share some of the results. All right, so with that being said, Jamie, you ready to do this?

[2026-01-21T18:41:40.775Z]
All right.

[2026-01-21T18:41:41.255Z]
So here we go. So let's pretend that Jamie has just walked into the showroom. And for now, let's just say Jamie is by herself. We've been talking for, like, five minutes. I'm not going to do this, by the way. The first, like, three seconds. I know. Jamie. I'm going. To do this after a couple of minutes of building rapport. But before I show her any boats or product or solution, we need to do a great discovery. The honest agreement sets up a world class discovery. It is foundational for that discovery. All right, so Jamie's just walked in and here we go. So, Jamie, before. We do anything in terms of looking at boats today? And I can see you just staring at all those boats in the showroom right now.

[2026-01-21T18:42:22.855Z]
I want to have an important conversation with you because, as you know,

[2026-01-21T18:42:26.695Z]
This is a big deal. You said this earlier. It's like this is your first. This is your first boat. And I know you don't want to make any mistakes, and we want to get this right, and I want to make sure we get this right.

[2026-01-21T18:42:35.735Z]
So here's my commitment to you.

[2026-01-21T18:42:38.615Z]
For as long as we know each other. Jamie and I hope today is the first day of many days of us knowing each other.

[2026-01-21T18:42:45.015Z]
I'm always going to be honest. I'm always going to be candid. In other words, as we're talking about your boat, your needs, I'm going to tell you exactly what I would want to hear myself. Because I feel like you deserve the truth. Always. And I feel like you would want that. Is that fair?

[2026-01-21T18:42:59.095Z]
Despair. Okay, awesome. Yeah, good. Now, at the same time, you're going to notice we're a little bit different than a lot of dealerships. What I mean by that is a lot of dealerships, you come in and they immediately start showing you boats.

[2026-01-21T18:43:13.575Z]
But what's the problem if they just start showing you boats and haven't asked you any questions yet?

[2026-01-21T18:43:19.095Z]
You may not know my style or know my needs or understand what would be a good fit for me. That's exactly right. Which means we might make mistakes. And I said we're not going to make mistakes. So this is how we do it. What we're going to do is we're going to. Go sit here at this table.

[2026-01-21T18:43:34.055Z]
And we're just going to talk. We're going to talk about where this started for you, where you are today and where we're going with this. I really want to understand the why behind this. Now, you're going to find I'm going to ask you some questions that you've probably never been asked before.

[2026-01-21T18:43:47.575Z]
I'm sure of it. In fact, when I asked you these questions, my ask for you is that you just push through them with me. You do your best to give me your best answers. Because if you do, it's going to ensure that we choose the perfect boat, the perfect solution for you. Can you do that? Absolutely. Sweet. All right, so now we've sat down. Now, one final ask I have for you. And I'm thinking, wow, you're asking me a lot. I know. Because we got to make sure we start this relationship perfectly, and that is this.

[2026-01-21T18:44:16.855Z]
I want you, Jamie, to know you can always be honest.

[2026-01-21T18:44:22.135Z]
With me.

[2026-01-21T18:44:23.495Z]
Let me give you an example.

[2026-01-21T18:44:24.775Z]
Today we are going to look at some boats. We're going to look at some stuff.

[2026-01-21T18:44:29.095Z]
Now, if at any point you see something, if I present to you something that you don't like.

[2026-01-21T18:44:37.095Z]
What do you need to tell me in that moment?

[2026-01-21T18:44:39.655Z]
I don't like that, though. Exactly. You didn't tell me you don't like it. Yes. And is that a good thing when you tell me that? I think it's a very good thing. Yes. It's a good thing. Because now, instead of us just placating each other and just playing, the nice game. The nice thing is always the honest thing. That's what we believe here at Sheridan Marine in boats, supply.

[2026-01-21T18:45:05.335Z]
So with that being said, I promise you, no matter what you tell me,

[2026-01-21T18:45:09.255Z]
I'm going to receive it as a gift. So for as long as we know each other, Jamie, can you commit to being 100% open, honest and transparent with me?

[2026-01-21T18:45:19.015Z]
Marcus, I will.

[2026-01-21T18:45:20.855Z]
Great. Now, jamie.

[2026-01-21T18:45:23.895Z]
Before you met me. And I don't know how much you've had on this before. Like, you know, I know I've done a lot marines, so I don't want to be assumptive here.

[2026-01-21T18:45:34.295Z]
Before you met me.

[2026-01-21T18:45:37.175Z]
Did anybody in your dealership set the conditions, set the stage with the buyer like that?

[2026-01-21T18:45:45.175Z]
Yes.

[2026-01-21T18:45:46.855Z]
Yes, I have my honest agreement script. It is something that we have been practicing heavily in the past couple weeks. So. Yeah. Good, good. Now, before. Before you had heard of it, were you doing it to that degree or were you doing it differently? No. No. Where near? No. Okay. So what has been the by the way for everybody? Listening. Jamie's not a plant, by the way. She was randomly called. So if you're. If you're thinking, I think he planted this one. No, Jamie was just, like, perfect. I'm so glad that we called on you, Jamie. Now, before. What has been. What has been the difference that you've noticed? In terms of the effect that this has on the, let's say, the ability of the salesperson to connect with the buyer versus before, if any.

[2026-01-21T18:46:31.655Z]
Yeah, we can see a clear difference at the when the customer will tell us, and I can attest to that myself. When I'm on the phone with someone, we said the appointment, and I say, hey, you know, like, we do this, and they're showing, they're showing up more. And if they, they, if they can't make the appointment, then they are letting me know. So there's been a tremendous difference, but yeah, right. So you have to do the thing, right? You have to tell people, listen, if you can't make the appointment,

[2026-01-21T18:47:03.175Z]
What do you need to tell me? Like. Well, I need to let you know, is it going to hurt my feelings? No, it's not going to hurt my feelings. Like, you're doing the same thing on a micro level, right? But you're doing the same thing because your job, to your point, is to make sure that if you're setting appointments that people show up.

[2026-01-21T18:47:19.975Z]
And they. We're not wasting people's time. Jamie, this is so good. So, one last thing.

[2026-01-21T18:47:25.335Z]
Have you found that this was just 100% natural and easy for salespeople in yourself, or have you had to practice it?

[2026-01-21T18:47:33.735Z]
We practice it every day. Wow, this is making me so excited. What's the name of your company, by the way?

[2026-01-21T18:47:40.615Z]
Reader trash Marine.

[2026-01-21T18:47:42.055Z]
Oh, Rita Trous. Let's go read a trial rtm word. Okay, so that was. That was great, Jamie. You just. You just crushed that. So what. What. What I want everyone to do is I want you to just. You don't have to do it right now, but you can just take a few notes.

[2026-01-21T18:48:01.255Z]
What did you like about it?

[2026-01-21T18:48:03.335Z]
And how could you use this if you would in the chat?

[2026-01-21T18:48:06.695Z]
If you would in the chat.

[2026-01-21T18:48:08.615Z]
What questions do you have about the honest agreement?

[2026-01-21T18:48:12.135Z]
And let us know what stood out to you. What did you notice in the chat? Just go and put it.

[2026-01-21T18:48:17.335Z]
And this is the one that is going to require the most work for your team. And this is why I just want to share it with you because, you know, we start off one to one with as a leader, I start off an honest agreement with a team member doing an honest agreement as well. So this is one of those things. You're going to use it? I've done this many times with my kids.

[2026-01-21T18:48:36.055Z]
And you're going to, you're going to evolve it depending on the moment. If you've done an honest agreement with somebody before, you're going to call back the honest agreement. So it's one of those things where you will refer back to the honest agreement many times in your life. But this is one of those things where, you know, when it comes to your sales team, it will change their life if they. If they do this. And they'll start to say things like, honestly, I just don't like. I don't like the color. I don't like the design. I don't think the. Plan is right for us. I'm worried about the fact that you all are such and such, okay? And so that's what makes this so powerful. Becca, any observations from the. From the comments that came in there?

[2026-01-21T18:49:13.575Z]
I had a lot of observations. A lot of people are saying they appreciate how much you explained the feedback and that it was a gift and it changed their perspective on the honest agreement in general. I know some people are saying, well, what do you do? I have one question specifically. Cool. Ask a question. All right. So what do you do if somebody interrupts you and they don't really appreciate the raising the stakes part and try to. Yeah, well, so rarely does that happen if you do this.

[2026-01-21T18:49:43.335Z]
Oftentimes, if anybody's in sales, you know how often there's, like, almost like this little ying and Yang battle at the beginning, the seesaw of who's going to have control of this conversation. And if the prospect has control of the conversation, generally, the closing rate plummets to almost nothing. So. Unless you're leading the conversation. And obviously you should be leading it in a righteous way, in a correct way. But unless you're leading it, you're probably going to lose the deal entirely. And so oftentimes, if somebody does interrupt and doesn't. But if somebody did interrupt, I would, I would quickly repeat myself and establish I would come right back with the question or write back with the commitment.

[2026-01-21T18:50:24.135Z]
I would say now, before we do that, can we do this like I want to? We're going to go through the commitment. I might say, all right, we're definitely going to cover that, but I want to cover this first.

[2026-01-21T18:50:34.695Z]
I'm going to be respectful. We're going to do it in what we call a yes and way, which is making sure the energy is right. I don't want to. I don't want to demoralize the person. I don't want to instigate the person, but I want to. Send a message of that's coming. Let's cover this first. All right. That's a really good one. Any other ones, Becca, that you notice that we should cover now? No specific questions, just showing how it really clear communication and honesty is the big takeaway from the mistake that I see people make is they. Don't notice. It took me, like, five minutes to do that with Jamie, who was amazing. And the sad thing is a lot of you are going to try to do this your first time, and you're going to do in 30 seconds, you're going to say to the person, all right, this is a really important conversation, I promise to you, is I'm going to be honest. I'm going to ask you some really deep questions, and I want you to know you can be honest with me, too. Does that sound good to you?

[2026-01-21T18:51:27.895Z]
That is not an honest agreement. They're going to say fine, and you're going to see that the results are the same.

[2026-01-21T18:51:36.935Z]
I would challenge you to know that this is possible.

[2026-01-21T18:51:39.975Z]
I would also have you know that most of your salespeople, especially if you've never learned from our team at the question first group, if you never heard about the Pathfinder system, they're not doing this. And if you did this, if you really mastered it, it's not something you say in a minute. Now, if I've met with you many times as a team member, I might say it in 45 seconds, yes.

[2026-01-21T18:51:59.975Z]
Because I'm just reiterating, we're going back to it and we're recommitting for that honest agreement together.

[2026-01-21T18:52:07.175Z]
Great. All right.

[2026-01-21T18:52:08.935Z]
So you'll see within your workbook that you have a scorecard. What's wonderful about this is you can watch and observe your team. You can observe yourself, and you can fill out the scorecard. And scorecards are a really big part of learning these skills and seeing where your team is and understanding like, okay? Did I use pauses in silence? Did my tone match the seriousness of the conversation? Was the pace steady and not rushed? Was my facial expression and energy matched by my words? See a big part of doing the reps.

[2026-01-21T18:52:43.735Z]
Is the face says so much. And you'll be amazed when you're watching your sales reps have their face says something very different. Oftentimes their face says, I'm thinking about the next thing that I want to ask. Whereas they're not building energy with their face, with their hands, with their body. This is all a part of an effective scorecard and effective experience for the buyer. So you want to make sure, you want to make sure you do that. You got a few other components of your workbook here.

[2026-01-21T18:53:15.415Z]
Biggest challenge I want to give to you is use the honest agreement in the next 24 hours.

[2026-01-21T18:53:20.215Z]
Use it with some, like, just a friend or what? Like, Becca did this with a team member. Because Becca does an honest agreement whenever anybody reaches out to us about events. And it's crazy. Once we started doing this, we started having a dramatically higher number of events tell us to be honest. Our budget is. Whereas before they just would hire someone else without letting us know. So. It's been amazing the impact it's had on the company. It's no surprise that once we started, once Becca came on board,

[2026-01-21T18:53:47.495Z]
I trained her on the honest agreement. She was doing the honest agreement with every single company that reached out to us. Suddenly, our schedule exploded because we have a different rapport than we've had in the past. Really, really powerful. Okay, make sure you fill this out, please, because it's going to make a big difference. And then make sure too, you know how you're going to practice it.

[2026-01-21T18:54:10.615Z]
And be honest with yourself. Is there any reason I might avoid using the honest agreement? The only reason would be that it's clunky for you and that you feel uncomfortable with it. Those are the most honest reasons why people don't do it. All right. And so my challenge to you is that you do it. And in fact, because this workbook is so awesome, by the way, this workbook was designed by the incredible Scottish lad named Chris Marr. Chris Ma. Who is amazing. And so if you like the workbook in the chat, you can say, thank you, Chris Ma. You can sign here, you can sign and say, all right. In my next important conversation, I commit to using the honest agreement. It really is amazing. Practice it. Practice it often. Okay, let's do another one. Let's do another one, which is the pushback pivot.

[2026-01-21T18:54:56.135Z]
Pushback pivot.

[2026-01-21T18:54:58.535Z]
Will diffuse an unbelievable ways. Moments that in the past have caused you to put your foot in your mouth, that have caused the conversation to go off the rails, that have caused you to be really, really sad or frustrated or embarrassed. And this is sales. And this is life. Okay? Now I want you to think of. And this is. Very important. We're not going to spend a ton of time with this right now, but what are the five most common objections or pushback that you're the most in sales conversations? So, Becca, let's call on somebody for this because I think this would be a really good one to hear from somebody and hopefully that person will help me out. Let's go with Austin Nuns. Is that how you say your last name? If I pronounce it perfectly. Austin. Captain Big Dog. Nothing much. Just excited to be on the call. All right, man, I love that energy. What do you sell, Austin? So I'm a product manager for. A construction software company. Yeah. Let's go. A little B2B SaaS. All right.

[2026-01-21T18:56:04.055Z]
What would be. Let's talk about your five most common objections that you hear. Fire away, if you would. Number one.

[2026-01-21T18:56:13.015Z]
Sure number one is price. Okay, and how does that objection manifest? Do they say, you're too expensive? Do they say, hey, why don't you talk about price at all? How does it might say it a few different ways.

[2026-01-21T18:56:25.255Z]
Yeah, most of the time it comes from, well, we're still in alpha, so a lot of the times they're like, hey, what is the pricing going to be? So we typically something like, hey, we just want you to use our stuff and give us the feedback.

[2026-01-21T18:56:35.575Z]
That's where they were at right now.

[2026-01-21T18:56:37.255Z]
All right. Good. Good. All right. So what's another objection?

[2026-01-21T18:56:40.535Z]
Yeah. The next one is training.

[2026-01-21T18:56:42.935Z]
As with any software, any construction company, they are really concerned about what effort it's going to take them to get all their people onboarded. Good. So what's the exact phrase they use?

[2026-01-21T18:56:54.455Z]
I'm worried about or I'm concerned with. It's really good to start your concerns with that phrase, because now it almost guarantees you'll say it exactly as the prospect says it.

[2026-01-21T18:57:06.695Z]
That's a good one. Did you see what's happening right now? As you're. As you're. As you're thinking about this now, Austin, everybody, you want to learn to say objection statements exactly as the prospect says them, because now it forces a lot of clarity in terms of your ability to identify. It.

[2026-01-21T18:57:25.975Z]
And practice it and prepare for it. So, with that being said, Austin, what's the exact way they say it?

[2026-01-21T18:57:31.575Z]
Yeah, I've heard it as I'm worried about what it's going to take to get our guys to use this. Oh, good. That's, by the way, that's a little bit different than training, isn't it? That one is buy in and implementation problem. Right. So I'm worried that my team won't implement this.

[2026-01-21T18:57:49.655Z]
Perfect, or I'm worried about what it's going to take for my team to implement this money. That was good. Let's just do one more. Austin. Yeah.

[2026-01-21T18:57:59.815Z]
I'm gonna be honest. I've only tried demoing this to two people brand new to the game, so those are the main complaints we've gotten. Good. Good. Now, right now, if someone says, I'm worried about my team buying into this,

[2026-01-21T18:58:12.695Z]
What would be your exact response? And give me word for word what you would normally say.

[2026-01-21T18:58:20.775Z]
What I would normally say is, hey, I appreciate your concern, and that's really good feedback. And that's something we strive to make easier and easier for the customer. Good. Stop right there. This is great. This is great. What you're doing already, of course, is you're starting to defend.

[2026-01-21T18:58:39.415Z]
And as you're now doing this, Austin, you're losing ground.

[2026-01-21T18:58:44.295Z]
You're losing authority.

[2026-01-21T18:58:46.695Z]
You're responding to this exactly as 90 plus percent of reps would respond to it. All right, so that was really, really great that you said it that way. By the way, everybody give Austin around. Applause screen. Because you were a money big dog.

[2026-01-21T18:58:59.895Z]
I love it. Thank you. Good job, man. That was great.

[2026-01-21T18:59:03.175Z]
Now. You're going to see in a second, Austin, how we want to respond to that.

[2026-01-21T18:59:09.095Z]
Because if you could learn a simple technique that would ensure that you would never have to defend or flinch again, what impact would it have it on you, on you, on your life, on your sale team, on your personal life? It would be phenomenal. And that's what the pushback pivot does. You want to start? Though, with the most common objections. And once you have that, now we're going to look at the order of how this works. Let's continue along in your workbook. So when somebody says something negative to you, a negative phrase like, I'm worried about how much buy in, I'm worried about my beam. Not buying into this.

[2026-01-21T18:59:49.095Z]
Okay?

[2026-01-21T18:59:50.535Z]
What are the steps?

[2026-01-21T18:59:53.255Z]
They're right here. You got to have in one fell swoop. We want to have the right energy.

[2026-01-21T18:59:57.655Z]
We want to repeat the negative word or word used, and then we want to discover or ask a question. And the question is usually something like, please tell me more. Now I just said that. And you're like, that sounds so basic. Are you serious? That's the grand finale. No, no, stay with me. I promise this. Is going to make sense as we do it together. And I want you to see it, I want you to feel it, because it's so beautifully impactful. So energy is the beginning, because oftentimes somebody might respond to something and they're almost gritting their teeth and you can tell he's pissed. At me right now, you know, somebody says,

[2026-01-21T19:00:31.975Z]
Somebody says, gee, I feel like you guys are so expensive. You're like, we don't want to stay like that. We want to have face. The face that matches the moment. The energy of the body is a huge part that salespeople miss.

[2026-01-21T19:00:47.655Z]
So when somebody says something to you, especially in a sales situation,

[2026-01-21T19:00:52.375Z]
Generally speaking, your face, your body should show as if you're putting across this message of. I've been waiting for you to ask that all day. I can't. I've been so excited for you to ask that question. All right, so if somebody says, my goodness, you guys are so expensive, you're like expensive.

[2026-01-21T19:01:09.575Z]
Please.

[2026-01-21T19:01:10.535Z]
Tell me more. Now. I just did the pivot.

[2026-01-21T19:01:14.615Z]
So let's look at what we did. So we've got the energy. We've got the energy. Now I'm going to break each one of these down, and then we're going to practice together. All right? And so, Becca, I'll have you call on somebody to do this here in a second. Maybe we'll use two people.

[2026-01-21T19:01:29.255Z]
So we want to receive the objection without surprise. We want to have the same posture. The posture shouldn't change. We shouldn't get tense. We want it to land right. We want to stay open and neutral and curious. And we want to make sure we're not flinching, we're not speeding up our voice. We're not getting restrictive, all these things. All right? So that's step one to the pivot. Now, step two is we want to repeat the exact negative phrase they said. And so if somebody says, I'm worried about my team not buying in, the response would be worried about your team not buying it. Or you might say not. You're not buying in. Please tell me more. So we want to focus on the negative phrase. We might say not buying in. All right, let's talk about that.

[2026-01-21T19:02:18.775Z]
It's the same thing. We want to take the exact words. The problem we see with salespeople is they try to put words in the mouth of the person, and then it goes sideways because the person doesn't feel heard and understood. So the person says, you know, I'm just really frustrated with the situation.

[2026-01-21T19:02:36.855Z]
And then the salesperson says, so what you're saying is that you would prefer to do this differently person? Like, no, I'm pissed off. I'm frustrated. See what I'm saying? We don't want to change the words. We want to use the words, repeat it verbatim. You want to keep it short. You allow it to stand on own.

[2026-01-21T19:02:56.695Z]
Now avoid the extra words. Do not soften the language. Right? Like, use what they say.

[2026-01-21T19:03:04.935Z]
Use what they say.

[2026-01-21T19:03:07.255Z]
So somebody says more expensive than everyone. You'd say more expensive. Please tell me about that. Someone says your number is just higher. You say numbers higher. All right, let's talk about that.

[2026-01-21T19:03:20.055Z]
See my face. Somebody says it's done, the line.

[2026-01-21T19:03:24.295Z]
Don't feel like lines. Let's talk about that.

[2026-01-21T19:03:28.295Z]
Frustrated. Tell me more. Same thing. Now, third step. Third step is. That's when we discover. That's what we discover. We want to ask a single question here.

[2026-01-21T19:03:38.695Z]
Not multiple questions. The more questions you ask, the less effective you are as a communicator.

[2026-01-21T19:03:45.095Z]
We see this a ton with salespeople. This is also why you should not stack questions. I guarantee if you watch your call recordings, you will find that you will oftentimes ask a prospect more than one question at a time. Do not do this bad habit. We ask single question, we get answer. Ask another single question. We get answer. So we want to make sure that we're asking it singularly. Let the buyer do the work, and that's the key. This is when we now make them explain the thing. We don't apologize for what they just said. We don't try to help them out. We allow them to. Say the thing.

[2026-01-21T19:04:26.615Z]
That's how it works. And the way we do that is by saying things like, tell me more, can you explain that? Or what makes you feel that way? Or what makes you say that? Or what exactly do you mean by that? Or could you give me specific example of that? Whatever. Whatever it is, but we make them. Explain the thing. And then by doing that, now all of a going to disarm. We're going to diffuse the situation. You're not going to put your foot in your mouth. You're not going to be embarrassed. You're not going to say, oh, my gosh, I cannot believe what I said. Today. This person said, you're expensive. I'm like, we're expensive because we don't suck. And person, like, all of a got mad at me, and I was like, I was just being honest. We don't want to say it.

[2026-01-21T19:05:04.295Z]
That way. So now we're going to do some real examples. And as a reminder, the way this works is you're going to find the negative word of words, you're going to repeat it.

[2026-01-21T19:05:15.975Z]
And then you're going to say, tell me more or Tell me about that.

[2026-01-21T19:05:20.375Z]
Or whatever that. Whatever that discovery phrase is. Okay, so, Becca, who is our lucky person? All right, Dana Thomas, you're on my screen. Oh, Dana Thomas is a childhood friend. Oh, Dana. How are you, buddy?

[2026-01-21T19:05:36.535Z]
Good. Doing really good, man. You want to talk about somebody with wonderful energy, Dana Thomas. You hang around him for about five minutes all of a you feel like you can conquer the world. All right, Dana. All right. We're going to do the pushback pivot. I'm going to show you a statement. You don't. Know what the statement is.

[2026-01-21T19:05:52.295Z]
Your job is to repeat the negative word of words.

[2026-01-21T19:06:00.535Z]
By the way, can you bring Dana up? I can't see him on the screen. I want to be able to see him. Yeah, let me. When he talks. Don't need to talk again.

[2026-01-21T19:06:06.375Z]
Is that better? Does that work for you? Can you see him now?

[2026-01-21T19:06:09.895Z]
Did it move me yet?

[2026-01-21T19:06:12.135Z]
There it is. Now I can see. All right. Good. All right. Marcus, man, you're so handsome. All right, here we go. Here we go.

[2026-01-21T19:06:18.855Z]
All right, first one, Dana. First one.

[2026-01-21T19:06:23.095Z]
Is.

[2026-01-21T19:06:24.615Z]
Dana. Yeah.

[2026-01-21T19:06:25.815Z]
I got to be honest, I am super frustrated with my role here.

[2026-01-21T19:06:31.095Z]
Oh, okay. So what you're saying is that sounds weird.

[2026-01-21T19:06:36.135Z]
So you're frustrated. What I'm hearing is that you're frustrated.

[2026-01-21T19:06:39.255Z]
Can you tell me more about that?

[2026-01-21T19:06:40.615Z]
Good.

[2026-01-21T19:06:41.735Z]
I love how you worked through that, big dog. Do you notice, Dayton? Did you notice how it got so much simpler and more effective when instead of saying multiple words,

[2026-01-21T19:06:53.015Z]
You just said frustrated.

[2026-01-21T19:06:55.575Z]
Right.

[2026-01-21T19:06:56.695Z]
Yeah. Can you tell me more about that?

[2026-01-21T19:06:59.975Z]
It was now.

[2026-01-21T19:07:02.295Z]
Because you were struggling, because you were trying to find words instead of using the singular word that they used.

[2026-01-21T19:07:09.815Z]
But now by saying frustrated.

[2026-01-21T19:07:12.935Z]
Please tell me more about that.

[2026-01-21T19:07:15.815Z]
You see how by sitting in the word now, they really feel our energy and our presence with them.

[2026-01-21T19:07:23.175Z]
And it makes your job way easier as the leader, because you're not fumbling.

[2026-01-21T19:07:27.335Z]
Right. All right. Ready to do another one, Dana? Sure. Let's go for it, big dog. Here we go, Dana.

[2026-01-21T19:07:35.575Z]
I gotta be honest.

[2026-01-21T19:07:37.255Z]
I believe I deserve a raise.

[2026-01-21T19:07:39.735Z]
All right, so you wanna. You wanna raise.

[2026-01-21T19:07:43.975Z]
Tell me what you're thinking about this.

[2026-01-21T19:07:46.135Z]
Good. Now, this time when we do it,

[2026-01-21T19:07:49.015Z]
I want you to not add any words other than the key phrase.

[2026-01-21T19:07:56.455Z]
Right.

[2026-01-21T19:07:57.095Z]
So did you notice how you said all right?

[2026-01-21T19:08:00.135Z]
Even, all right.

[2026-01-21T19:08:03.335Z]
Takes away in that moment from the flow of the conversation.

[2026-01-21T19:08:10.535Z]
So if you look at this, the negative word or words, it's not really negative, but it's the friction point. Right? Is what.

[2026-01-21T19:08:18.295Z]
What is the negative phrase here or the friction point? Deserve. Yeah, deserve.

[2026-01-21T19:08:23.975Z]
Deserve or deserve a raise, Right. In the context of this is probably deserve a race simply because it sounds a little bit cleaner to say deserve a raise. Right. Deserve a raise. So.

[2026-01-21T19:08:34.295Z]
If you say all right.

[2026-01-21T19:08:38.375Z]
So you feel like you deserve a race? Tell me more. It's good. And it's better than most people are gonna do.

[2026-01-21T19:08:43.655Z]
But if you say deserve a race.

[2026-01-21T19:08:46.535Z]
All right.

[2026-01-21T19:08:47.575Z]
Tell me about that.

[2026-01-21T19:08:50.375Z]
Now all of a We've got perfect flow.

[2026-01-21T19:08:52.695Z]
So you just. You reverse the.

[2026-01-21T19:08:55.415Z]
Okay, I see. Okay, just start with the start. Don't even. Don't even add in. Just go right to the word. Repeat the words. They were gonna do one more. You're doing great, by the way. Dana. And so good to see you, man. I love you, dude. You too, man. I miss you.

[2026-01-21T19:09:11.495Z]
Dana, I gotta tell you, your department give me terrible customer service.

[2026-01-21T19:09:21.095Z]
I'm having a hard time not saying something verse.

[2026-01-21T19:09:27.015Z]
So saying it well, so terrible customer service.

[2026-01-21T19:09:32.615Z]
Let's talk about that more.

[2026-01-21T19:09:34.135Z]
Yeah. Good.

[2026-01-21T19:09:36.455Z]
That was great. Now.

[2026-01-21T19:09:38.935Z]
Notice, too. Sometimes the way you say things, we're not going to necessarily say terrible customer service. Tell me more about that. Because we got to match the energy to the moment. But what we're teaching you to do here, Dana.

[2026-01-21T19:09:53.175Z]
And this is for everybody.

[2026-01-21T19:09:54.695Z]
For your sales team. And notice how I'm actually doing leadership examples, because this is actually perfect, right, for you, Dana. Yep. Yeah. But what's powerful about this is I never want you to flinch again.

[2026-01-21T19:10:05.495Z]
And I want you to feel like no matter what, you're thrown, you're ready for the moment.

[2026-01-21T19:10:10.935Z]
And you're ready for it. Because you pivoted the energy, you got pushback, you quickly pivoted, and you just know the simple step. I'm going to make sure my energy is right.

[2026-01-21T19:10:21.415Z]
I'm going to repeat the exact words, and then I'm going to get them to explain it.

[2026-01-21T19:10:26.935Z]
Really, really on that. Yeah. This is very good. I mean, this aligns with nonviolent communication. This is me taking the moment, me caring about their concern and just focusing on showing I care about that concern. I love it.

[2026-01-21T19:10:42.935Z]
That's. That's exactly right. All right, I want to do one more person here. Great job, Dana. Thank you, buddy.

[2026-01-21T19:10:48.615Z]
Daniel Burkholder. Thanks, Dana. Dana. I appreciate it. Daniel, come off mute, man.

[2026-01-21T19:10:54.535Z]
There we go. I'm ready.

[2026-01-21T19:10:56.775Z]
Oh, look at this guy.

[2026-01-21T19:10:59.175Z]
Like awesome people here today. Like, I'm ready. That's the energy that you want your salespeople to have and you want your team to have. All right, so ready to do this, Daniel? You're going to take the negative word of words and you're going to have. Have me explain more. You. Don't know what's coming, so you're put on the spot. Here it is, Daniel. The service tech was rude to me.

[2026-01-21T19:11:17.335Z]
Rude. Tell me more.

[2026-01-21T19:11:19.095Z]
Good.

[2026-01-21T19:11:19.895Z]
Good. Perfect. My goodness, this one is expensive.

[2026-01-21T19:11:24.695Z]
Expensive. Tell me more.

[2026-01-21T19:11:26.455Z]
Yeah. Yeah. Now, I'm going to challenge you. This time, I want you to use a different phrase than Tell me more. Although it's fine. It's 100% fine. It's just. It's a good. When you're doing fast reps like this, we want to change the discovery phrase. A few times. Here we go. Your delivery schedule doesn't align perfectly with our needs.

[2026-01-21T19:11:45.975Z]
Doesn't align.

[2026-01-21T19:11:47.495Z]
Please explain that to me.

[2026-01-21T19:11:49.655Z]
Good. Good. Good. No, that was good. The best thing you did, though, is you found the negative phrase. The friction point. The friction point was. Doesn't align. That was the shortest one you could have chosen, and it had the exact result. Now, of course, I know you're thinking, but that was money.

[2026-01-21T19:12:06.215Z]
So good. Let's do one more. Dan, you're crushing this. Your competitor had a bigger model at a cheaper price.

[2026-01-21T19:12:16.055Z]
Bigger model at a cheaper price. Please tell me more about that bigger model.

[2026-01-21T19:12:20.535Z]
Okay, good.

[2026-01-21T19:12:21.815Z]
Great job. Great job. Now, here's what's wild, Daniel, is if we went to your sales team right now and we just went down the list, how many? And you may, may or may not have a team. Right. But would they would they know just to immediately ask the question or what percentage would get defensive and this could be with your team now or teams that you've worked with in the past. What's your thoughts on that, Daniel?

[2026-01-21T19:12:47.255Z]
So I am the team. And I would get defensive 100%.

[2026-01-21T19:12:50.215Z]
Good. Good. And because you get defensive, what impact have you seen that have in the past?

[2026-01-21T19:12:58.695Z]
The. The conversation just gets out of control because suddenly you're playing defense rather than leading the conversation.

[2026-01-21T19:13:05.415Z]
You're kind of trying to get in front of it again.

[2026-01-21T19:13:07.495Z]
Yeah. And what's beautiful about this is you can use this at home.

[2026-01-21T19:13:11.175Z]
You can use this with team. You can use this with sales.

[2026-01-21T19:13:16.055Z]
And the key, though, is you have to sincerely want to know what they're intending or meaning with their words. If the sincerity is not there, it will manifest, and it will not be done in the right way. It will not be done with integrity. Okay?

[2026-01-21T19:13:32.695Z]
So just. I want you to reflect on this a little bit. And as we look at this honest agreement. Daniel, thank you again. You were. You were great. Danny, you were great, too. Just as a. As a. As a reminder, when you're doing the. Excuse me. When you're doing the pushback pivot.

[2026-01-21T19:13:50.055Z]
Here's some mistakes to avoid not using.

[2026-01-21T19:13:53.415Z]
Be careful. We want to use their exact words. It's a mistake when you don't.

[2026-01-21T19:13:58.375Z]
Be careful about your body language.

[2026-01-21T19:14:01.975Z]
Make sure. It's. It's. It's. You know, don't. Don't abandon the thing that you're doing. Don't rush.

[2026-01-21T19:14:10.455Z]
You know, watch the flinch. So these are just different mistakes to avoid. It's there for you. It's there to help you now.

[2026-01-21T19:14:17.895Z]
We told you as part of this that we're going to give you a couple of tools. So one of the ones I, that I've, we've built for you at question first group is called the pushback pivot coach.

[2026-01-21T19:14:29.415Z]
This is great, because what you can do is you can go into this custom GPT and this is on ChatGPT, and you can do reps with it. And it's really helpful. I did it myself. And then it will grade you out on your reps. It'll tell you how you can improve. It's just great. It's just great to do it and to get your, you know, like, in the right headspace. This is especially good.

[2026-01-21T19:14:52.455Z]
To do with somebody that's onboarding on your team. It's really, really powerful. That's a link to it. We will send you the slide deck. So you're going to have the slide deck. So don't worry if you don't, you know, you don't have to, like, run. To it right now, but it's there for you.

[2026-01-21T19:15:05.655Z]
Also, and this is the one that I'm most excited about for you.

[2026-01-21T19:15:09.895Z]
This one is a pretty advanced custom GPT and this is called Pathfinder Discovery. Questions. The whole goal that we tried our mission at Question First Group is to create Pathfinders. Pathfinder is someone that understands it's not their job to always have the answers, but it is their job to ask extraordinary questions because if they ask extraordinary questions, they're going to cause breakthroughs in those that are around them. Growth, deep connection and progress, whatever the situation is in the moment. And that's what we call a Pathfinder. A Pathfinders are world class at asking the right question, the right time. Many of your, many of your sales people, many of you watching this right now. You're not asking questions at the depth you could in the discovery process. When you're going through the sales process, I want you to see the questions you could be asking.

[2026-01-21T19:16:05.655Z]
To do this.

[2026-01-21T19:16:06.935Z]
This tool will help you with your honest agreement, and it'll help you build out what we call the foundational five, which is essentially when you have this beautiful relationship with a customer because you asked five specific questions, honest agreement being one of them, that set the tone for the entire relationship and allowed you to understand their very deep. Why B2B? B2C. Doesn't matter. So this tool, extremely powerful. It's free. There's no opt in or anything like that. It's yours to use, and I'm really excited that you have it. Okay. And so you can get it. You can get it right there also. One other thing that we want to give you. Again, this is like give. It's like the mini version of Alex Hermosi. He's really great at giving the whole world. We're just trying to do our mini Alex here today. And with this, if you want the four pillars of breakthrough sales communication, there's. A leadership book there, too. It's free on the site. It's free to download. You can order the paperback. It's a quick book. It'll take you a couple hours to read, but you're going to absolutely love it. And it will teach you the system that we use. And it's called the Pathfinder's Way. So I absolutely hope that you will. That you will use that. So I want to. As we're closing out, I want to look at your one thing.

[2026-01-21T19:17:24.535Z]
And I'm hoping everyone from this call will put in the chat something and don't leave yet. Don't leave yet. It's important. Okay. By the way, we've had a huge like, almost everyone has stayed, which is really, really impressive. So thank you for that and appreciate you Let us we haven't done this with question first group before. This is our first, you know, big training. We're going to every at the beginning of every year, we're going to do a sales kickoff like this, and I think you'll see regular webinars. We're trying to give you trainings. We're trying to give you a ton of value. Where you notice the majority of this was about coaching. We had to set the conditions early, but then, boom, all coaching. So if you had to say the single most important insight from today, if you had to say it,

[2026-01-21T19:18:02.775Z]
What was it?

[2026-01-21T19:18:03.815Z]
What was it? If you had to say the single most important insight from today, what was it? So if you would, if you would go ahead and put some of those, some of those in here. I love that a couple of you have already said role play, and I just love that. Stop practicing on your customers. Great. One Will that's really, really good. Slow down the conversation. Ah, yes, yes, yes.

[2026-01-21T19:18:28.135Z]
So good. And that's going to be contingent on your. On your tone, in your style, all right? That's what's going to. That's what's. You know, that's what's going to happen. So if you do this, all right, if you do this, I want you to just write. This as well in the chat, if you would.

[2026-01-21T19:18:44.855Z]
And this is in your workbook, too. What is the impact it's going to have on you, personally or professionally? What is the impact that it's going to have on you, personally or professionally? And, Beckett, let me know if any. Any good ones are. Are coming in. I got to reiterate. We just did. Two things. You've got this workbook and in the workbook you're introduced to some other pillars. Pillars that you will find in the. In the book that. The Pathfinder's Way. It's going to be there. The four pillars of breakthrough Sales communication. You're going to learn about really what. It is to be a Pathfinder and the Pathfinder's compass. You'll be able to identify what's type of communicator you are and where some of your flaws are manifesting. You're also going to learn the Four Pillars.

[2026-01-21T19:19:30.055Z]
Of the Pathfinder's Way, which are all about energy and how we ask questions and how we get in front of issues. And so you're going to love that vanguarding question. First Law 3 very, very powerful, life changing. Becca, any good comments come through that you that you'd be willing to share with us.

[2026-01-21T19:19:52.135Z]
They're non stop, to be honest. So this is really good. I think one that stands out is personal growth as a 28 year old veteran that can always learn new things. Oh, that's cool. That is really, really cool. Does anybody have any questions that you have heard? Any questions that you'd like to ask that's on your mind. And if you want, you can. You can use the raise hand feature. We can even bring you off mute. You can put in chat, or you can. Or we could just handle it right here. I do want to remind you this.

[2026-01-21T19:20:24.535Z]
What you learned today will only matter if it shows up tomorrow.

[2026-01-21T19:20:28.535Z]
So the question is, will you train to make sure it keeps showing up? That's my hope, is that you just love training, that you love personal development. I've been obsessed with my communication skills since I was about 19 years old. I'm not kidding you. I've thought about communication and how it works. Every single day for the last 30 roughly years. And I love teaching sessions like this because it gets me more excited to get better and to keep learning and to keep noticing and to keep building frameworks.

[2026-01-21T19:21:00.295Z]
And you know, if we teach it enough, eventually we'll probably master it as well. I know. That's certainly my goal. Beck, two things. One, I want to shout out Brockton. He said competence. Being able to stop surviving in sales calls and be more customer focused. Currently, I'm selfishly focused on getting my goal out of a sales call. So that's a really takeaway. That is so true. In the Pathfinder is the one that is the customer can feel the prospect, can feel how invested they are. And they know it's not about the salesperson, it's about what is the best solution right now. They really, really feel it. And they know that if they're not the best, like if your product or service is not the best solution, that you'll be the first to tell them. Because there's that much trust in the relationship and because there's that mistrust, they actually end up buying. They look for reasons to buy from you because they've never had that type of connection with the salesperson before. That's what's possible. Does anybody else have a question? Yes, we have a question. Like, I don't know about this. Marcus. One thing somebody did ask is if you can explain the Pathfinder's. Compass that you touched on. And if so, we can always send us one of the tools on the website, too. Marcus yeah, we'll send that out with. There's basically four communication styles that most leaders and salespeople have. One is called the instructor. The instructor is not great at asking questions. They're good at teaching, but they're not great at asking questions. Therefore, the people around them don't have breakthroughs because of it and they create dependency. Then outside of the. The instructor, we've got this person that's we call the lawyer. And the lawyer is good at asking questions, but the problem is they. Ask questions for their own gain. And that doesn't help the person grow either in their manipulative. You've probably met the lawyer before. We also have the dictator. The dictator doesn't ask questions well at all. They just tell people what to do. You see people in sales do this. You see people in leadership do this. The problem is the person oftentimes ends up regretting their decision. They don't grow and it stunts their development and it doesn't lead to any breakthroughs. And then you have the Pathfinder. And the Pathfinder is one that's world class at asking questions, and it's. All about the prospect or the team member. And they are constantly making heroes out of others and creating breakthroughs in those persons because they understand how to have a perfect energy, how to ask the perfect question every single time. So it's a beautiful skill to develop, and it's. It's where you want to go. And that's. We're going to. As a company, we're going to create 10 million pathfinders around the world. That's our mission and vision. And we appreciate you being a part of it. And that's why I hope you get the books and start to apply it to your life.

[2026-01-21T19:23:41.735Z]
Any others before? We got a couple. So one that's really good, too, is Jamie's asking, how do you know when the right time is to bust out the honest agreement? Sometimes it feels too soon, she says.

[2026-01-21T19:23:55.495Z]
Yeah, I think it's a really, really great question, Jamie. And it's one of those where the most important thing is before you present any solution.

[2026-01-21T19:24:06.455Z]
Full stop.

[2026-01-21T19:24:07.655Z]
And before you go into discovery.

[2026-01-21T19:24:12.055Z]
Because what you don't want is you don't want to be going to Discovery. And they're thinking, so when are we going to, like, start to look at stuff? Or you don't want them to say, why are they, like, asking me questions? I don't know about that question. We want to set the conditions for what's coming.

[2026-01-21T19:24:28.055Z]
Now, should you, though, have a semblance of positive energy and trust with the person already? Yes, Lisa, semblance of it. That's that happens through that lighter conversation. So you are going to probably ask a few other questions before then. But they're lighter questions. They're not really deep. But then once we're ready to transition into really true discovery.

[2026-01-21T19:24:50.455Z]
That's when we start with the honest agreement. Normally that means somewhere around the five minute mark after you've met the person. Okay. In most cases, it's about five minutes. Great question, Jamie.

[2026-01-21T19:25:00.695Z]
Excellent. One thing that I can touch on, somebody asked if someone isn't wanting to communicate through anything other than email, can you write an honest agreement? And I would say, Marcus, we've seen this a couple times where we've done an honest agreement, not through and through, but partially via email. And it's worked out really well. Yeah. The big key is letting the person know they won't hurt your feelings by telling you the thing. So in other words, like, for me as a speaker, I might say, hey, it's totally okay to let us know that you found another speaker. It's not going to hurt our feelings. We just want to make sure to, you know, to. We wanted to make sure to find out before we went ahead and moved you off the list or something like that. Whatever. Whatever you want to say. But the point is, we want to say the thing they're afraid to say. We verbalize it. They're afraid. To say, I found another speaker. So you say it for them, and now you're much more likely to get the answer. So that's the key to doing it with email.

[2026-01-21T19:25:59.655Z]
But don't use email as a crutch.

[2026-01-21T19:26:02.375Z]
Obviously.

[2026-01-21T19:26:03.895Z]
All right, let's stop it there. We hope you had a great experience today. I appreciate you make sure we're connected on LinkedIn. If we're not. And until the next time, everyone, which we'll probably do this again in a few months. I hope you have an amazing 2026 and on behalf of the Question first group. We love you. We appreciate you. God bless. Thanks.

[2026-01-21T19:26:24.135Z]
Have a good one.
