# Meetings

This folder contains meeting summaries that don't belong to a specific project.

## Structure

```
Meetings/
└── YYYY/
    └── MM/
        └── YYYYMMDD-meeting-slug.md
```

## What Goes Here

- Cross-project meetings
- General/personal meetings
- Webinars and recordings not tied to active projects
- Any meeting where "Chief of Staff (general)" was selected during routing

## What Goes Elsewhere

- Project-specific meetings go to `[Project]/logs/YYYYMMDD-meeting-[slug].md`
- Raw transcripts go to `~/Documents/Meeting Transcripts/`

## Created By

The `/meeting-review` skill creates files here when processing meetings that aren't routed to specific projects.
