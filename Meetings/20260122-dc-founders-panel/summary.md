# Event: AI Use Cases & Startup Growth: DC Founders Panel

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Time:** 6:00 - 8:00 PM
**Location:** Founder Institute @ WeWork, 1701 Rhode Island Ave NW, Washington, DC
**Type:** Networking Event / Panel
**Organizer:** The Founder Institute
**Projects:** Chief of Staff

## Summary
DC-area AI startup panel with networking. Event quality was underwhelming - more casual than professional (Dominos pizza, Miller Lite). A few interesting companies but mostly standard AI plays.

## Companies/Speakers

**Rohic** - Standard AI marketing tool. Ingests brand materials, creates style guidelines, generates marketing/sales copy. Nothing differentiated.

**Hupside** - More interesting than initially expected. Worth a second look.

**Delve** - Government-focused AI. Not relevant to my work.

**Sallam** - Educational game teaching empathy, created by a founder inspired by his mother. Interesting concept worth checking out of curiosity.

## Key Takeaways

- **Foundation models are commodities** - Multiple speakers emphasized not relying too heavily on any single model. Build for portability.
- Event quality reflects organizer quality - note for future Founder Institute events

## Connections Made

- Met the Sallam founder - seems like an interesting person/product outside my usual space

## Notes to Self

- **Founder Institute events:** Expect casual/low-budget atmosphere. Beer and pizza vibe, not professional networking. Calibrate expectations accordingly.
- **Sallam:** Look up the educational game out of curiosity
