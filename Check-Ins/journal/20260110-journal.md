I finally went to my first AI Walks meetup today. It's a meetup organized by Amir Feizpour (https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirfzpr/), which is exactly what it sounds like. You walk and talk about AI. It was a good group, very diverse in all ways - age, gender, profession, culture, AI proficiency. It was a miserable day - driving ran and cold. But there were probably two dozen people who braved the elements to walk for two hours around Hains Point in DC.

Met a guy who - Dammon Burden - works at ID.me who is trying to help push non-technical teams use AI more. I tried to learn more about his efforts - what worked, what didn't - but didn't get too far. He mentioned they use Glean and if I could put together something related to that, we could do a session. I'm more tempted to find out more and see if we could do an AI lunch and learn for a particular deparment, sort of like I did with SalesIntel. In any case, he seems like he is a good connection. He has no sway, but he's definitely someone who tries to push things on his own. He was a bit weird. He way overpaid for his share of lunch, on purpose, and without that I would have been short by at least $40, so I was thankful for that.

Met a several others who were interesting and potentially helpful.

Bob Weir died today. End of an era. Will Dead & Co go on without him? No Jerry and no Booby is surely the end, no?
