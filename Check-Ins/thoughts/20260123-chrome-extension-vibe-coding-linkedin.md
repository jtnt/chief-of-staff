## LinkedIn Post

I vibe coded a Chrome extension that disables the Return key from submitting your prompt in AI chatbots.

My wife said, "it's cool you know how to do that." (I'm pretty sure she wasn't being sarcastic.)

But the fact is, I don't know how to do this. But I know it can be done. And I did it.

This is the difference now. The barriers are nearly non-existent. All that's left is your own curiosity and desire.

The question isn't, "Do I know how to do this?" (No, but I know how to get it done.)

The question isn't even, "Can this be done?" (Almost always yes.)

The question is, "Will I do this?"

p.s. The extension is as awesome as it sounds. Return = line break. Shift+Return = submit. No more premature submissions! (There's a clever name for the extension in here somewhere. 😂)

## Context

Built a Chrome extension using AI assistance. Return key now creates line breaks in AI chatbots instead of submitting. Shift+Return submits.

**Image:** Screenshot showing LinkedIn post origin (saved in workspace attachments) - "can we get a setting that lets us put in line breaks with the return key?" and "AI chatbots need 'forgotten attachment' warnings like Gmail has."

## Notes

This captures a shift in mindset: from "do I know how" to "will I do this." The technical barriers are essentially gone. What remains is curiosity and desire.

Wife's reaction was genuine appreciation (probably).
