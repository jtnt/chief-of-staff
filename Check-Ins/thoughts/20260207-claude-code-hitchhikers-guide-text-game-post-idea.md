# Post Idea: Claude Code as Hitchhiker's Guide Text Game

Claude Code is currently like the text-based video game Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

- It's literally played in the terminal
- It was fascinating and addicting at the time — couldn't stop playing
- Just like Claude Code

**To do:** Find a screenshot of the original Hitchhiker's Guide text adventure game to use as the hook/visual.

**Angle:** The parallel between terminal-based interaction being compelling then and now. The "game" framing — Claude Code as something you play, not just use.
