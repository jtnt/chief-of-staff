## What I Want to Accomplish Today

It's Saturday, but I want to do some work if I can.

**Priority tasks:**
1. ~~**Finish migrating jtnt.io to Dreamhost**~~ - ✅ Completed 2026-01-25
2. **CPF thinking and planning** - explore the advanced context network version from Chris McConnell meeting, figure out the MVP and real problems to solve
3. **Finish JRAD setup** - waiting on Peter for DNS setup

## Context Profile Framework Thinking

Had a meeting with Chris McConnell yesterday where I discussed the more advanced version of the context network in detail. Want to explore that more and plan how to make a product out of it - what the MVP is, what the real problems are.

## Interesting Context Repo Discussion

Joe Rhew (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joerhew/ - https://www.wfco.co/) posted about automating context repo updates. He outlined a 4-stage roadmap:

1. **Stage 1: I do, AI helps** - Human drives updates, AI assists with drafting
2. **Stage 2: AI surfaces, I decide** - AI monitors sources and surfaces drift, human decides
3. **Stage 3: AI does, I approve** - AI makes changes autonomously but staged (PR workflow), human reviews/merges
4. **Stage 4: AI does** - Full automation, no review (he doesn't think anyone should actually do this)

His take: Stage 3 is the sweet spot - 90% efficiency with 100% control.

**My comment on the post:**

This points to one of the three structural challenges with maintaining context profiles for a business. None are insurmountable, I'm just identifying them.

One is the **creation challenge**. Automation and connections to data can only get you so far, at some point a human needs to bless the things that will be the source of truth for the entire company/department/etc.

The second, in order of when a company encounters it, is the **access/relevance challenge**. That is, how to determine what from the context profile is necessary and sufficient for the AI to do its task. At scale, you'll have data on a lot of stuff, only some of which is relevant to any particular task.

The third is what you bring up, the **maintenance challenge**. As you rightly point out, full automation is probably not even desired, even if it's possible. Again, automation and data connections might only get you so far or could even exacerbate the problem.

All of these are very interesting to think about how to solve.

**His reply:**

All great points.

On point 2 specifically - I use two different approaches.

For pre-determined workflows, I have a default composition of contexts that I can call via API; the default contexts can be overridden or augmented with runtime contexts.

For non-pre-determined flows, I use agentic search. Query the agent and let them use tools to find the right contexts to retrieve. For the latter, I can see this only getting better over time - and hopefully the improvement in capability keeps up with the speed at which my context repo expands.

**Notes on Joe:**
- Technically a competitor - actively building context profiles (calls them "context repos") for clients
- Homing in on GTM niche, which is smart
- A bit too locked into Claude Code
- There's room for all, and we've struck up a good dialog
