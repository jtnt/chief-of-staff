# Morning Check-In - Monday, February 03, 2026

**Time:** 11:05 AM EST

## Intentions
- Beekeeper Group meeting at 3 PM (talk about their AI use, potentially discuss training)
- Air Hops February 2026 cohort homework (finish watching session + homework)
- Record LinkedIn video about Google Docs auto-sync to Claude projects (3-5 min, first foray into video)
- If time: Start I-Corps mentor application work

## Today's Calendar
- 3:00 PM - Let's Talk AI Meeting (Beekeeper Group) - 1 hour, Google Meet

## Context Surfaced
**From CoS Inbox (5 pending items):**
- Boris Cherny Claude Code tips (voice dictation, prompt vocabulary improvements)
- Automation recommendations waiting for review
- Skills/hooks ideas from earlier session

**Priority alignment question raised:**
- Beekeeper meeting aligns with P0 (Razzo revenue path - potential training client)
- I-Corps application relates to CPF/entrepreneurship context
- LinkedIn video: General content creation vs. targeted Razzo/CPF content?

## Priority Alignment
Mixed - Beekeeper meeting and I-Corps work align with revenue focus. Question about whether LinkedIn video is strategic or just "more content."
