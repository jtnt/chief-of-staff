# Evening Check-In - Wednesday, February 04, 2026

**Time:** 6:11 PM EST

## What Happened Today

### Projects
- **AirOps Cohort**: Completed Session 1 homework, attended the live AI Marketing Cohort session
- **Beekeeper Group**: Attended Apollo sales call with Alex Dickson — sounds like Alex wants to talk next steps, likely cementing the engagement. Moving to proposal phase.
- **Chief of Staff** (meta-work): Diagnosed/fixed runaway MCP processes, rewrote meeting review system (866 → 314 lines), reviewed pattern suggestions, reorganized client folder structure (shared context into Razzo/z_context/)

### Meetings
- 1:00 PM - AI Marketing Cohort w/ AirOps
- 2:00 PM - Apollo Sales 30 Min - Beekeeper Group (Alex Dickson)

### Key Decisions
- Beekeeper: Next step is a call to get on the same page, then develop a plan and proposal
- Moved shared client context materials from `Clients/z_context/` into `Razzo/z_context/`
- Created CLAUDE.md files for all client folders with Razzo context references

### Insights
- Beekeeper engagement moving from exploratory to proposal phase — real revenue work
- Simplicity beats over-engineering (meeting review rewrite)

## What's Carrying Over
- Beekeeper Group: Schedule call with Alex, develop engagement plan and proposal
- Envoy client skills build (Razzo worksheets → client-facing prompts)
- I-Corps mentor prep
- Writing (6 days since last publish)
