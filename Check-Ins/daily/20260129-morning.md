# Morning Check-In - Thursday, January 29, 2026

**Time:** 10:48 AM ET

## Intentions
Continue CPF work from last night - building out the main agent framework that creates the core documents.

## Today's Calendar
- 3:00 PM ET - AI Tools & Techniques webinar (pipeline generation in age of AI search)

## Context Surfaced
- **CPF momentum:** Last session built comprehensive Mythos context profiles - agent framework work is natural next step
- **Published this morning:** LinkedIn post about Claude Code bubble (filed to Writing/Published)
- **Meta-work note:** At 77% this week - CPF work is productive project focus

## Priority Alignment
CPF agent framework work aligns with getting back to project work and away from system building.
