# Morning Check-In - Wednesday, January 28, 2026

**Time:** 8:50 AM EST

## Intentions

Make revenue progress on CPF. Stop just writing about it - do something productive that points toward turning this into something that drives revenue.

**Key tensions identified:**
- Context Profile Builder app exists (functional MVP) but feels like "too much baggage" to continue
- Could rebuild from scratch (have comprehensive PRD)
- Or pivot to service-first model: develop processes/templates through client work, then productize

**Mythos/MoreVang as potential test case:**
- Use them to develop solid process templates
- Learn real pain points and barriers through actual delivery
- Challenge: no existing documents (but that's actually the ICP - creation friction is the problem)
- Could pitch to Jon (CEO)

**Core question:** What problem am I actually solving? Creation, maintenance, or access? Creation is first barrier.

## Today's Calendar
- **All day** - Product-Led Summit | Washington, D.C. 2026 (bailed)
- **3:00 PM** - LCL

## Context Surfaced

**CPF Strategic Fork:**
- Path A: Service-first (Joe Rhew model) - develop via client work, productize later
- Path B: Product-first - rebuild app fresh
- Path C: Hybrid - use client work to validate, build internal tools to support delivery

**From project-knowledge:**
- Open question: "Is general-purpose the right bet, or should we pick a domain?"
- Framework identifies three challenges: creation, maintenance, access
- Creation friction is where everything stalls
- Octave validates context infrastructure thesis (but they're GTM-specific point solution)

## Priority Alignment

This aligns with stated priority to make CPF revenue-generating. Moving from theory/writing to actual service delivery or product decision.

## Next Action

Before diving into code OR client work, spend 2 hours documenting what you'd actually DO with Mythos as a client:
- What's the process?
- What tools would help you?
- What's the deliverable?
- What would you charge?

This exercise will clarify whether to fix the app, rebuild it, or put product aside and focus on service delivery.
