# Evening Check-In - Tuesday, February 10, 2026

**Time:** 8:30 PM EST

## What Happened Today

### Proposals (Client Work)
- **Mythos-More Vang**: Finalized v8 proposal with Razzo-branded Word document and email draft. Fixed razzo-docx skill (Lexend font issue, border clearing, footer dividers). Ready to send to John Bunnington.
- **Beekeeper Group**: Developed complete 8-version proposal with $6,000/month pricing, conservative ROI case (3:1 return). Razzo-branded Word document and email ready. Ready to send to Alex.
- **Proposal QA Automation**: Built `/razzo-proposal` skill to prevent ~40% of revision rework on future proposals. Includes reference templates and pre-delivery checklist.
- **Proposal Process Analysis**: Analyzed 16 proposal versions across both clients. Identified "genre establishment" as critical bottleneck. Recommended 6-step workflow to replace 8+ version cycles.
- **Folder Cleanup**: Standardized folder structure (202602_ai_advisory convention), organized drafts/, renamed final versions to remove version numbers.

### Content Creation
- **Google Docs Sync Video**: Recorded and posted tutorial on syncing Google Docs to Claude Projects. First tutorial-style video (24+ takes). Posted to LinkedIn. See [[../../../Writing/published/20260210_google-docs-sync-claude-projects/post.md]]

### Systems & Meta-Work
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Fixed subtask parsing (title extraction, description routing), improved rendering, added copy button context. Subtasks now work as standalone prompts.
- **Razzo-docx Skill Fixes Round 2**: Cleared style borders, fixed markdown handling (warn about `---` markers), implemented dotted footer borders matching template.
- **Skill Separation**: Fixed `/thought` and `/link` routing ambiguity. Stripped URL logic from `/thought`, added explicit redirect to `/link` for any content with URLs.
- **Chief of Staff Research**: Captured Carl Vellotti Personal OS article. Identified 5 improvement ideas (GOALS.md, workflow-scoped CLAUDE.md, Knowledge/People/, _temp/ capture, pointers-over-content audit).
- **Writing Idea**: Captured AI Compounding Process Improvement concept — use AI retrospectives to analyze revision history and codify improvements for future work.

### Research Captures (Context Profile Framework)
- Brian Madden second brain research (individual AI context at scale)
- Madden gist interview framework (practical implementation guide)

### Morning Priorities
- ✅ Finalize and send Mythos proposal (ready to send)
- ✅ Record Google Docs video (posted to LinkedIn)
- ✅ Create Beekeeper proposal (ready to send)
- ⏳ Start I-Corps Mentor prep work (in Active tasks, not started)

## Key Insights
- Proposal development has two distinct phases: genre/structure establishment (currently takes 2+ hours), then content refinement. Process conflates them.
- QA automation at delivery time (skill-based) prevents rework better than global writing rules (CLAUDE.md).
- Cross-project log search was broken — fixed by adding explicit instruction to global CLAUDE.md and memory file.

## Open Items
1. **Send Mythos proposal** to John Bunnington (proposal-email-final.md ready)
2. **Send Beekeeper proposal** to Alex (proposal-email-final.md ready)
3. **I-Corps mentor prep** — 3 sub-tasks due today (interest form, prep course, video interview with Glen)
4. **Video feedback** — requested feedback on tutorial video format
5. **Evaluate Carl Vellotti Personal OS patterns** — backlogged for future CoS iteration

## Spillover to Tomorrow
- I-Corps mentor prep tasks (3 sub-tasks still pending)
- Monitor proposal responses from clients
- Continue writing on AI compounding idea if time allows
