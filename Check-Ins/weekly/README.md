# Weekly Check-In Synthesis

Automated synthesis files generated by `/morning` on Mondays.

## How It Works

When you run `/morning` on a Monday:
1. Reads all evening check-ins from the past week (`Check-Ins/daily/*-evening.md`)
2. Synthesizes patterns, accomplishments, themes
3. Creates `YYYY-WXX.md` file in this folder

## File Format

```markdown
# Week [XX] - [Date Range]

## Last Week Summary

### Accomplishments
- [From evening check-ins]

### Projects Active
- [Project]: [Summary of activity]

### Patterns Noticed
- [What got attention vs skipped]

### Carried Over
- [Items that kept carrying over]

## This Week

### Suggested Focus
- [Based on patterns]

### Watch Out For
- [Things that got neglected]
