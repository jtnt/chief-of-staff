# Steve Cunningham's AI Operating System for Business

## Who Is This Guy

Steve Cunningham. San Antonio, TX. Former lawyer (lasted a week), ran a digital marketing agency for 12 years, read 3,650+ business books, founded Readitfor.me (book summary platform). When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it could do his core job in 5 minutes. Instead of fighting it, he dismantled his business and rebuilt around AI-native operations. Now runs three interconnected ventures:

- **Humans+Agents** (humansplusagents.ai) — AI-native professional services firm. 311 agents across 10 departmental OS modules. Platform at $1K/year, services from $6K/month.
- **AIROI Association** (roiassociation.ai) — Professional community and training for AI-native consultants. Four tiers. Includes "The Full-Stack Consultant" book.
- **Simple Academy** (simpleacademy.ai) — AI Black Belt certification program. Claims to be the first AI-first business school.

23K LinkedIn followers. Claims clients at Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, Nike, Starbucks, FedEx. Pricing ranges from $1K/year (platform) to $50K/year (CEO peer group).

## The Core Thesis

**AI crossed the 50% win rate against credentialed human experts. The bottleneck shifted from expertise to context.**

He cites a "GDPval study" (September 2025) — reportedly the first blind evaluation of AI vs. industry experts across 57 professional domains. Win rate progression:

| Period | Model | Win Rate |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Early 2024 | GPT-4o | 12.4% |
| Mid 2025 | Various | 25-35% |
| Late 2025 | Opus 4.1 | 47.6% |
| Dec 2025 | GPT-5.2 | 70.9% |

Below 50%: AI is a draft accelerator (requires expert review). Above 50%: AI produces expert-quality output directly. The constraint flips from "what you know" to "what context you provide."

**The AI Arbitrage Window:** Brief period where this capability exists but most people don't realize it. Those who master context engineering now capture disproportionate advantage. Window measured in months, not years. Closes when the skill becomes common.

## The Operating System — How It Actually Works

### Folder Architecture

Cunningham structures his entire business as an AI-readable org chart:

```
Operate/
├── COO.md                    # Master onboarding doc for every AI session
├── Marketing/
│   ├── Advisors/             # Decision frameworks, competitive intel
│   ├── Agents/               # Task execution instructions (the Skills)
│   ├── Context/              # Brand voice, strategy, personas
│   ├── Design System/        # Visual standards, colors, typography
│   ├── Templates/            # Output formats for common deliverables
│   └── Projects/             # Active work, one subfolder per project
├── Sales/
│   └── [same structure]
├── Product/
│   └── [same structure]
└── [etc. for each business function]
```

**The key insight:** Every AI session starts with "Go read the COO folder and get yourself onboarded." The AI reads its instructions, understands the business context, navigates to the right department, absorbs context files, and executes with full awareness of brand, strategy, and standards. It's organizational design applied to AI — not prompt engineering.

### The Continuous Improvement Loop

At the end of every work session, three things happen:

1. **Invoice generation** — AI calculates what the work would have cost externally (his famous "$14K in 30 minutes" example)
2. **Session wrap-up** — Documents what got done, what system improvements were made during work, what the AI recommends improving
3. **Overnight implementation** — AI implements the recommended improvements to context files, templates, agent instructions

He wakes up every morning with a better system than when he went to sleep. Compounding daily.

### HTML as Universal Format

Controversial take: HTML won the file format wars. His argument:
- Office formats (Word, PPT) = terrible for LLMs (messy code underneath)
- Markdown = good for LLMs but bad for humans (no images, no visual hierarchy)
- HTML = works for both. LLMs trained on the entire internet (HTML). Humans consume it natively in browsers. Supports full visual design.

Built a drag-and-drop publishing tool (Folio) around this. Generate HTML with AI, publish instantly. No WordPress, no dev team.

## The Commercial Model — 729 Services Canon

This is the most ambitious piece. A complete taxonomy of every consulting engagement:

**9 Domains x 9 Specialties x 9 Projects = 729**

### The 9 Domains

1. **The Growth Firm** — Marketing & demand gen (SEO, paid media, brand, PR, content, ABM, email, social, events)
2. **The Revenue Firm** — Sales & CS (training, RevOps, pricing, proposals, channel, CS, GTM, lead gen, key accounts)
3. **The Capital Firm** — Finance & accounting (fractional CFO, valuation, M&A, tax, forensic, turnaround, wealth, debt, audit)
4. **The Talent Firm** — HR & people ops (recruiting, comp, org design, DE&I, L&D, compliance, culture, outplacement, coaching)
5. **The Ops Firm** — Efficiency & supply chain (supply chain, procurement, lean/6σ, PMO, facilities, CX ops, ESG, quality, franchise)
6. **The Tech Firm** — IT & security (MSP, cyber, data/BI, dev, cloud/DevOps, ERP, AI/automation, product, digital transformation)
7. **The Strategy Firm** — Management & vision (corporate strategy, change mgmt, board advisory, innovation, PMI, crisis, family business, non-profit, gov)
8. **The Legal Firm** — Risk & regulation (corporate law, IP, employment, contracts, compliance, e-discovery, immigration, real estate, tax law)
9. **The Built Firm** — Real estate & construction (architecture, engineering, construction mgmt, owner's rep, development, tenant rep, urban planning, environmental, facilities)

Each specialty has 9 named projects. All 729 are documented with specific names (e.g., "The 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast," "The Churn Root Cause Analysis," "The Brand Perception Audit").

### Three Delivery Tiers

Each of the 729 projects can be delivered three ways:

| Tier | Price | Model | Capacity |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| DIY | ~$2K | Templates & frameworks, client executes | Unlimited |
| Done With You | ~$10K | Consultant works alongside client | ~50/year |
| Done For You | ~$50K | Full delivery | ~20/year |

**729 x 3 = 2,187 sellable service configurations.**

### The Wedge Strategy

Websites are the entry point. Most businesses have bad ones. AI collapses the old Custom-vs-Template tradeoff. The demo: a 5-agent workflow (Account Manager → Psychology Expert → Brand Story Expert → Creative Director → Lead Developer) produces a StoryBrand-style website in 10 minutes, replacing a $25K / 6-week agency engagement.

"Deliver the website. Get inside. Then sell the other 728."

### Growth Path

- Day 1: Master your 9 projects → $90K-$225K revenue
- Day 90: Add neighboring specialty → $180K-$450K
- Year 1: Own the full domain (81 projects) → $810K-$2M+

## The Training Stack — AIROI Operator Program

Five "Black Belt" certifications with progressive multipliers:

1. **Workflow Engineering** (1x → 2x) — Prompt engineering, context management, workflow design, quality control
2. **Deliverable Engineering** (2x → 5x) — Strategic deliverables, marketing assets, interactive tools, applications
3. **Performance Engineering** (5x → 10x) — Process diagnosis, standardization, systematic improvement
4. **Context Engineering** (10x → 100x) — Living knowledge systems, customer intelligence, institutional memory
5. **Agent Orchestration** (100x → 1000x) — Multi-agent workflows, autonomous systems, feedback loops

Maturity framework (UCASE): Understanding → Codification → Augmentation → Securing → Execution. Also presented as SCOPE: Study → Codify → Operationalize → Protect → Execute.

## The Three Platform Tools

### Repertoire
The project library — all 729 consulting engagements structured as deployable workflows.

### Folio
The publishing engine. Code → Paste → Publish. Generates HTML from LLM output, hosts it instantly. Key use cases:
- Personalized proposals in 5 minutes (vs. 3 days traditional)
- Product pages in 20 minutes
- Interactive content at near-zero cost

Template libraries: Overture (proposals with SPIN + StoryBrand), Signal (lead magnets), Repertoire workflows.

### Atelier
The builders studio. Weekly live-build sessions where Steve builds SaaS apps in real-time. Members get full code access, prompt libraries, architecture patterns, coaching. Core thesis: consultants who build "micro-assets" (small custom software for individual clients) become embedded infrastructure rather than replaceable vendors.

## Key Frameworks and Concepts

### The Performance Tax Model
Five factors that degrade AI from demonstrated to realized capability:

| Tax | Multiplier | What It Means |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| Outdated Model | x0.80 | Using last-gen when current exists |
| Insufficient Context | x0.50 | A sentence when a paragraph is needed |
| Vague Specifications | x0.70 | "Write a report" without format, audience, purpose |
| Single-Shot Methodology | x0.60 | No iteration or refinement |
| No Quality Testing | x0.80 | Shipping without validation |

Most users pay all five taxes. 70.9% demonstrated → much lower realized.

### The Broken Tradeoff Pattern
Every professional service was priced around a constraint that no longer exists:

| Service | Old: Pick One | New: Both |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Content | Quality OR Volume | Both |
| Proposals | Custom OR Fast | Both |
| Research | Deep OR Broad | Both |
| Training | Personalized OR Scalable | Both |
| Analysis | Thorough OR Timely | Both |

"The firms that built their models on those tradeoffs are now over-engineered for a problem that's been solved."

### The Invoice Method
Generate receipts at the end of every AI session showing what the work would have cost externally. Changes planning behavior — you stop thinking in quarters and start thinking in daily sprints.

### Context Compounding / Moat Building
Over 24 months, a consultant's context library grows from ~20 items to ~104. Moat width goes from 10% to ~95%. Replaceability drops from 95% to ~5%. "The first consultant in wins. Context compounds. Moats widen. Replacement becomes impossible."

### Three Strategic Priorities (Post-AI)
When production costs approach zero:
1. **Distribution** — Audience and reach become the scarce resource
2. **Deployment + Feedback Loops** — Perpetual beta; ship improvements overnight
3. **Data** — Proprietary intelligence on how work gets done becomes the moat

### The Micro-Assets Thesis
Consultants who build small custom software (pipeline trackers, dashboards, workflow tools) for individual clients stop being vendors and become infrastructure. Each micro-app is a container where AI agents will eventually live. "Consultant who advises = replaceable. Consultant who builds = unfireable."

## What's Interesting Here (Editorial Notes)

**The folder-as-org-chart idea is the real insight.** Everything else is packaging. The mental model shift from "AI is a tool I prompt" to "AI is a company I run" is what makes the system work. COO onboarding → department navigation → context loading → execution mirrors how actual organizations operate. This is essentially what Claude Code skills and CLAUDE.md files do — but framed as an organizational metaphor rather than a technical one.

**The 729 Canon is simultaneously impressive and suspicious.** It's a beautiful taxonomy — comprehensive, well-named, clearly the product of someone who has read thousands of business books. But the question is whether each of those 729 projects actually has a robust AI workflow behind it, or whether the taxonomy is the product and the workflows are aspirational. The $1K/year founding member price suggests he's building the plane while flying it.

**The GDPval study needs verification.** It's cited repeatedly as the foundation for the entire thesis, but I couldn't find it independently. The win rate numbers are plausible but the specific study would need confirmation.

**Context engineering as the portable skill** is the concept most relevant to Razzo/CPF. His argument: you don't need domain expertise if you can extract, structure, and compile the context AI needs to perform in any domain. The CPF is essentially a context engineering tool. His "Performance Tax" model (showing how poor context cuts realized capability in half) validates the entire CPF premise.

**The continuous improvement loop** is the most operationally interesting pattern. Session wrap-ups that document improvements, then implementing those improvements overnight, creating compounding daily gains. This is what the CoS auto-capture system does in a lighter-weight way.

**HTML as universal format** is a genuinely useful insight for Razzo client deliverables. His argument that it's the only format good for both LLMs and humans holds up.
