## The Reality

**Professional services is a cost category that no longer needs to exist.**

Once installed, this category of spend disappears. Gone.

### Stats

- 99.8% cost eliminated
- 45 min internal

## FAQ

### How is this different from hiring an agency?

Agencies are vendors you keep paying. We're a system you buy once. You don't hire us — you install an operating system. The automated workflows become yours. The capability becomes yours. We set it up and train your team to run it. Then you own it.

### What kinds of work can this actually do?

First drafts of everything: reports, presentations, emails, analysis. Research and data crunching. Formatting and production work. Basically, everything that eats up your team's time but doesn't require their judgment.

### How do you ensure quality?

Every agent has built-in quality checks. Every deliverable goes through human review when needed. And our training ensures your team knows how to verify and improve agent output.

### What's the ROI?

Think about what you spend on agencies, consultants, and fractional roles. That entire budget category can go away — permanently. The platform costs $1,000/year. Most organizations eliminate 10-50x that in external services within the first year.

### How long does setup take?

You'll have access immediately. Basic training takes 2-4 weeks. Full rollout — with custom workflows across all departments and your team fully trained — typically takes 3-6 months.

### What if we already have AI tools?

Great. We integrate with what you have. Our value isn't the AI itself — it's knowing what to automate, how to set it up right, and how to train your team to use it.
