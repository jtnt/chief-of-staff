## Hero Section

**Founding Member Offer**

### The Tipping Point _Already Happened._

> "While most consultants were debating whether AI would 'change things,' it already did."

> "What you're about to see is the complete map of every engagement that every consulting firm on Earth sells — structured as workflows you can deploy. Today."

**Built from training delivered to leaders at:** Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, Nike, Starbucks, FedEx

---

## The Old Model

**Think about what consulting firms _actually_ sell.**

**A marketing agency** sells campaign strategy, content systems, customer segmentation, brand positioning, performance analytics.

**A fractional CFO** sells financial modeling, cash flow forecasting, budget variance analysis, investor reporting, compliance frameworks.

**A sales consultancy** sells pipeline optimization, CRM implementation, sales process design, territory planning, compensation modeling.

**An HR firm** sells talent acquisition systems, performance management, workforce planning, compensation benchmarking, employee engagement programs.

**A web design agency** sells brand strategy, customer psychology, UX architecture, and production code.

> "These firms built empires on specialized expertise. They hired armies of analysts. Developed proprietary methodologies. Spent decades building moats."

_That was the old model._

---

## The Proof

### $25,000 in 10 Minutes.

> "A marketing agency charges $25K and takes 6 weeks for a StoryBrand website buildout. Watch me do the entire thing — customer psychology, brand narrative, design system, custom-coded landing page — in a single recorded session."

---

## The Workflow

**01 First** — **Account Manager**
Gathers your business context. Who you serve, what you sell, what makes you different.

**02 Then** — **Psychology Expert**
Analyzes your buyer's dreams, fears, past failures, suspicions, and enemies. Full psychological profile.

**03 Then** — **Brand Story Expert**
Builds your complete narrative using the Hero's Journey. Character, problem, guide, plan, action, stakes, success.

**04 Then** — **Creative Director**
Presents 5 distinct design aesthetics: color palettes, typography, vibe, matched to your customer psychology.

**05 Finally** — **Lead Developer**
Writes the complete website. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Animations. Data visualizations. Mobile-responsive. Production-ready.

---

## Service Comparison

| | Agency | AI Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $25,000 | Included |
| **Time** | 6-8 weeks, multiple team members, revisions, meetings | 10 minutes, one conversation, production-ready |

---

## The Wedge

### Everyone You Know _Needs This._

> "Think about every business in your network. How many of their websites are actually good?"

1. **Poorly Messaged** — Nobody did the strategy work
2. **Badly Designed** — Template or dated custom
3. **Old** — Built years ago, never touched
4. **Expensive** — Cost too much to build or change
5. **Inflexible** — Locked into a template or developer

### The Old Tradeoff

**Option A: Custom Build** — Beautiful but frozen.
$15K-50K upfront. Need a developer for every change. Ends up frozen in time because updates cost too much.

**Option B: Template (WordPress, etc.)** — Editable but constrained.
Affordable, client can edit, but generic, limited, always fighting the theme instead of expressing the brand.

### The AI Reality

**The AI _is_ the backend.**

> "Custom design, generated in minutes. Need a change? Ask, regenerate, done."

> "No CMS to maintain. No theme to fight. No developer on retainer."

> "The website becomes a **living document**, not a static asset you're afraid to touch. Beautiful _and_ flexible. For the first time ever."

---

## The Pattern

### This isn't just websites.

> "What you just saw, a tradeoff that used to exist and doesn't anymore, that's the shape of _every_ professional service now."

| Service | Old Constraint | New Reality |
|---------|---|---|
| Content | Quality OR volume | Now both |
| Proposals | Custom OR fast | Now both |
| Research | Deep OR broad | Now both |
| Training | Personalized OR scalable | Now both |
| Analysis | Thorough OR timely | Now both |
| Contracts | Custom OR fast | Now both |

> "Every professional service was priced around a constraint that no longer exists. The firms that built their models on those tradeoffs are now **over-engineered for a problem that's been solved.**"

> "The website is the wedge, the one project you can lead with in every single engagement. The dramatic demonstration that gets you inside. Once you're in, you can see their sales process, their operations, their financials."

> "Deliver the website. Get inside. **Then sell the other 728.**"

> "Each one a broken tradeoff. Each one waiting to be delivered."

---

## The Repertoire: The Canon of 729

**9 Domains. 9 Specialties each. 9 Projects each.** Every engagement that every consulting firm on Earth sells, mapped, structured, and ready to deploy.

**9 x 9 x 9 = 729**

## The Fractal Architecture

### Click a Domain. See 9 Specialties. Click a Specialty. See 9 Projects.

- **9** Major Domains — The C-Suite
- **81** Sub-Specialties — The Firm Identity
- **729** Sellable Projects — The Menu

> "This isn't a list. It's a **theory of everything** for consulting. Start in your specialty, then expand across the entire map."

---

## The Delivery Matrix

### One Project. _Three Ways to Deliver._

> "Request any project from the Repertoire. We deliver the workflows to you. You deliver to the client, based on their budget, bandwidth, and appetite."

**Tier 1 — DIY:** You guide. They execute.
Workflows + guidance. Client runs the play. Client gets self-serve implementation at their pace.

**Tier 2 — Done With You:** You collaborate. They learn.
Shared execution. Client builds the muscle. Client gets internal capability they keep forever.

**Tier 3 — Done For You:** You deliver. They receive.
Full delivery. Client gets the outcome. Results without building the muscle.

### The Multiplier

**729 x 3 = 2,187**

One menu. Three delivery modes. Priced to fit.

---

## The Math

### The Economics Have _Inverted._

**Old Model:**
- Agency sends a team for 6 weeks
- Client pays $40,000
- You can't compete

**New Model:**
- You deploy the same engagement in one session
- Client pays $5,000
- You keep 100% of the margin

> "The big firms are trapped. They have overhead. Junior staff. Office leases. Partner comp structures that require massive engagements."

> "**You don't.**"

---

## The Unlock

### Start in Your Lane. _Then Expand._

> "You don't need to master all 729 projects. Start with the 9 in your specialty. Then look next door."

**Day 1 — Master Your 9**
You're an SEO consultant. You learn the 9 SEO projects in the Growth domain.
Revenue Potential: $90K - $225K (9 projects x $10-25K each)

**Day 90 — Add a Neighbor**
Content Marketing is right next door. You add 9 more projects without starting over.
Revenue Potential: $180K - $450K (18 projects)

**Year 1 — Own the Domain**
You now deliver the entire Growth Firm. 81 projects. Full-stack marketing services.
Revenue Potential: $810K - $2M+ (81 projects)

> "The map doesn't just show you what exists. It shows you **where to grow**."
