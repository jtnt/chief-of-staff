## Main Headline

**"The Tipping Point Is Here. Learn to Build."**

## Opening

> The capability threshold just crossed. What took teams and months now takes you and an afternoon. The consultants who learn to build software now will own the next decade.
>
> Atelier is where you learn. Watch me build. Get everything I build. Build alongside others.

- Watch the Story
- Join the Studio

---

## "A truth I need to tell you."

> I run an AI company... And until three weeks ago, I couldn't ship a SaaS app. Not a real one... Then something changed. The models got better. The tooling caught up. The tipping point arrived. Now I build complete, deployed, production-ready SaaS applications in a single sitting... A phase transition. And most people don't realize it happened yet.

-- Steve, Founder of AIROI

---

## The Shift: "The capability curve went vertical. Most people missed it."

> For years, AI could help you draft emails and summarize documents. Useful, but incremental. Then, in the span of weeks, it crossed a threshold. Now it can build production software. The gap between 'can help' and 'can do' just collapsed.

---

## The Proof: "Three SaaS apps. Built in one night. By me. Alone."

> Production applications with user authentication, databases, and real users. Each built in under 30 minutes. Total time: 75 minutes.

### What This Proves

> The barrier between 'idea' and 'shipped product' no longer requires a development team.

### What This Means

> Consultants can now build custom tools for clients, not just recommend them.

### Why Now

> The window is open. The people who learn this now will have an insurmountable head start.

---

## The Strategic Play: "The consultants who figure this out first will own their clients."

> Through infrastructure.
>
> When you can build a client a custom pipeline tracker, a reporting dashboard, a workflow tool, in an afternoon, you stop being a vendor. You become embedded.
>
> These are **micro-assets**. Small, custom software solutions built for individual clients. They weren't economically viable before. Too expensive to build for one client. Now they're trivial to create.
>
> And here's what most people don't see yet: every micro-app you build is a container. A place where AI agents will eventually live, acting on behalf of your client, using the tools you created.

### Consultant Comparison

**Consultant Who Advises:**
- Delivers recommendations
- Client implements (or doesn't)
- Engagement ends
- Easily replaceable
- Competes on price

**Consultant Who Builds:**
- Delivers working tools
- Client uses them daily
- Relationship deepens
- Becomes infrastructure
- Unfireable

> You're not just building software. **You're building the operating layer for the next decade.**

---

## Proof: "Let me show you what I built. Three apps. Under an hour. Total."

> A sales pipeline tracker. A daily focus app. A testimonial capture tool. All with authentication, databases, and live deployment. All built by me, with no code experience.

---

## The Studio: "Atelier is where builders gather. Learn by doing. Together."

> Atelier is French for 'workshop' or 'studio.' A place where craftsmen learn their trade by working alongside masters. That's what this is.

### Weekly Live Builds -- Watch & Learn

> Every week, I build something new, live. You watch the process, the prompts, the mistakes, the solutions. Real building, not polished demos.

### Full Code Access -- Everything I Build

> Every SaaS app I create becomes yours. The code, the prompts, the architecture. Fork it, modify it, deploy it for your clients.

### Builder Community -- Learn Together

> A private community of consultants learning to build. Share what you're creating, get feedback, see what others are shipping.

### Coaching & Support -- Get Unstuck

> Office hours, Q&A sessions, direct support when you hit walls. You won't be figuring this out alone.

> As my capabilities grow each week, **so do yours.** Everything I learn, you learn.

---

## The Value Stack: "Everything included. No upsells. No tiers."

# Linked Page: Repertoire (The Canon of 729)

Source: https://roiassociation.ai/repetoire

## Concept

> 9 Domains. 9 Specialties each. 9 Projects each. Every engagement that every consulting firm on Earth sells, mapped, structured, and ready to deploy.
>
> 9 x 9 x 9 = 729

## The "$25,000 in 10 Minutes" Demo

> A marketing agency charges $25K and takes 6 weeks for a StoryBrand website buildout. Watch me do the entire thing -- customer psychology, brand narrative, design system, custom-coded landing page -- in a single recorded session.

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Account Manager** -- Gathers your business context
2. **Psychology Expert** -- Analyzes buyer's dreams, fears, past failures, suspicions, enemies
3. **Brand Story Expert** -- Builds complete narrative using Hero's Journey
4. **Creative Director** -- Presents 5 distinct design aesthetics matched to customer psychology
5. **Lead Developer** -- Writes complete website (HTML, CSS, JS, animations, responsive, production-ready)

**Agency charges:** $25,000 over 6-8 weeks, multiple team members, revisions, meetings
**This demo:** 10 minutes, same deliverable, one conversation, production-ready

## The Wedge Concept

> Think about every business in your network. How many of their websites are actually good?

Problems: Poorly messaged, badly designed, old, expensive, inflexible.

> The website is the wedge, the one project you can lead with in every single engagement. The dramatic demonstration that gets you inside. Once you're in, you can see their sales process, their operations, their financials.
>
> Deliver the website. Get inside. **Then sell the other 728.**

## The Pattern: Old Tradeoffs That No Longer Exist

| Service | Old Constraint | New Reality |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Content | Quality OR volume | Now both |
| Proposals | Custom OR fast | Now both |
| Research | Deep OR broad | Now both |
| Training | Personalized OR scalable | Now both |
| Analysis | Thorough OR timely | Now both |
| Contracts | Custom OR fast | Now both |

> Every professional service was priced around a constraint that no longer exists. The firms that built their models on those tradeoffs are now **over-engineered for a problem that's been solved.**

## Three Delivery Tiers (per project)

**Tier 1 -- DIY:** You guide. They execute. Workflows + guidance.
**Tier 2 -- Done With You:** You collaborate. They learn. Shared execution.
**Tier 3 -- Done For You:** You deliver. They receive. Full delivery.

> 729 x 3 = 2,187 (One menu. Three delivery modes. Priced to fit.)

## The Economics

**Old Model:** Agency sends team for 6 weeks, client pays $40,000, you can't compete.
**New Model:** You deploy same engagement in one session, client pays $5,000, you keep 100% of margin.

> The big firms are trapped. They have overhead. Junior staff. Office leases. Partner comp structures that require massive engagements. You don't.

## Growth Path

- **Day 1 -- Master Your 9:** Start with 9 projects in your specialty. Revenue: $90K-$225K
- **Day 90 -- Add a Neighbor:** Add adjacent specialty (9 more projects). Revenue: $180K-$450K

# Linked Page: Folio (The Publishing Engine)

Source: https://www.roiassociation.ai/ai-folio

## Concept

> Your Entire Web Presence. Code. Paste. Publish.
>
> Take full control of your website, your proposals, your products, your thought leadership. No developers. No delays. No dependencies. Just you, your expertise, and a publish button.

## Key Metrics
- **5 min:** From sales call to personalized proposal page
- **20 min:** From idea to live product microsite
- **10x:** Engagement on interactive vs. static content

## The Shift: "From dependent to sovereign."

**The Old Way:**
- Wait for developers
- Fight your CMS
- Pay for every change
- Static pages
- Your website reflects who you *were*

**The Folio Way:**
- Publish yourself
- Code, paste, done
- Iterate infinitely
- Dynamic, personalized
- Your website reflects who you *are*

## How It Works: Three Commands

1. **Code** -- Generate production-ready code in your LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). Websites, proposals, product pages.
2. **Paste** -- Drop the code into Folio. No modifications needed. Handles hosting, domains, infrastructure.
3. **Publish** -- One click. Live. Client sees a custom URL with your work.

> You provide the expertise. Your LLM provides the code. **Folio makes it live.**

## Use Case 1: Personalized Proposals in 5 Minutes

> The discovery call ends. You have 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes until they forget -- 5 minutes until the urgency fades, the pain dulls, and "let me think about it" becomes the default.

**Traditional:** Open blank doc, try to remember what they said, write/format/rewrite, send 3 days later, hear nothing.
**Folio:** Paste call transcript, AI extracts insights, AI builds customized proposal, copy/paste/publish, send in 5 minutes.

**The 5-Minute Window visualization:**
- Traditional: Call ends -> "I'll send a proposal" -> Opens Word (2 hrs later) -> Still drafting (6 hrs) -> Formatting (Day 2) -> Sends (Day 3) -> "Let me think about it" (Day 4+)
- Folio: Call ends -> Transcript pasted (30 sec) -> SPIN extracted (2 min) -> StoryBrand applied (3.5 min) -> Code generated (4.5 min) -> SENT (5 min)
- Results: Time to Send: 72 hrs vs 5 min | Prospect Temp: 15% vs 98% | Close Rate: 23% vs 67%

## Use Case 2: Idea to Live Product Page in 20 Minutes

> You wake up with an idea for a new offer. In the old world, that's 6 weeks of design and development. In the Folio world, it's live before lunch.

What you could launch: Workshop landing page, course sales page, lead magnet opt-in, productized service, event registration, waitlist page, case study, pricing page.

## Use Case 3: Interactive Content at Zero Cost

> Building one interactive element meant writing briefs, hiring designers, finding developers, and waiting weeks. That's why consultants stuck to text posts.

**Before AI:** Brief (60 min) -> Find UX designer (3 days) -> Mockups (1 week, $3K) -> Revisions (1 week) -> Find developer (2 days) -> Development (2 weeks, $5K) -> QA (3 days). Total: 6+ weeks, $8,000+
**Folio:** Describe idea (1 min) -> AI generates (1.5 min) -> Review & tweak (1.5 min) -> Publish (1 min). Total: 5 minutes, $0

## The Ecosystem (Template Libraries)

- **Overture** -- Proposal Templates: SPIN extraction + StoryBrand structure
- **Signal** -- Lead Magnet Templates: Personalized outreach assets for specific prospects
- **Repertoire** -- Project Workflows: 729 consulting projects across 9 domains

## Who It's For

Independent consultants, fractional executives, EOS Implementers, Vistage Chairs, strategy consultants, operations consultants, AI/automation specialists, executive coaches, agency owners.

# Linked Page: The Book (The Consultant)

Source: https://www.roiassociation.ai/consultant

## Foreword by Steve Cunningham

> I spent two and a half years writing this book. In the final weeks, everything I had been waiting for arrived at once.

Key model release dates cited:
- November 12, 2025: ChatGPT 5.1
- November 18, 2025: Gemini 3
- November 24, 2025: Claude Opus 4.5
- December 11, 2025: ChatGPT 5.2

> This gap between what AI can do and what most people believe it can do is the largest arbitrage opportunity I have seen in my career.

## Chapter 0: The Summary

### 0.3 The Thesis

> AI Crossed 50% Win Rate Against Industry Experts. The Constraint Shifted From Expertise to Context.

**GDPval Study Results** (blind evaluation by specialist panels):
- Early 2024 (GPT-4o): 12.4% win rate
- 2025 progression: 24.3%, 25.5%, 27.9%, 34.1%, 38.8%, 47.6%
- December 2025 (GPT-5.2): 70.9%

### 0.4 The Opportunity: "The AI Arbitrage Window"

> Brief period when capability exceeds common knowledge about that capability.

Gap between demonstrated capability (ideal conditions, comprehensive context) and realized capability (typical user, minimal context).

> Those who master context engineering operate at the demonstrated level. Everyone else operates at a degraded level.

### 0.5 The Unlock: APQC Process Classification Framework

13 functional categories: Strategy, Products, Marketing, Logistics, Services, Support, HR, IT, Finance, Assets, Risk, Partners, Operations.

> Operating across domains does not mean operating without boundaries. Compliance, licensure, and regulatory requirements remain binding.

The portable skill: **context engineering** transfers across all domains.

### 0.6 The Demand

**Large Company Problem -- The Coordination Tax:** Functional silos create handoffs. Work crossing boundaries gets delayed. Projects requiring weeks take quarters.

**Small Company Problem -- The Capability Tax:** Cannot afford full-time specialists in every function. Must choose between going without capability or overpaying.

### 0.7 The Path

**Three Core Skills:**
1. Creative Thinking -- generates possibilities
2. Critical Thinking -- evaluates output
3. Systems Thinking -- connects components

**Five Stages of AI Process Maturity (UCASE):**
1. Understanding -- Examine process, learn AI capabilities
2. Codification -- Document as SOP
3. Augmentation -- Rebuild with context engineering
4. Securing -- Add edge cases, guardrails
5. Execution -- Transform into autonomous agent

### 0.8 The Deliverables: Three-Tier Model

1. **DIY** -- $2,000 tier: Templates, frameworks, guidance. Client executes. Scales infinitely.
2. **DWY (Done With You)** -- $10,000 tier: Work alongside client. Results plus capability transfer.
3. **DFY (Done For You)** -- $50,000 tier: Handle everything. Premium pricing, capacity-constrained.

### 0.9 The Engine

> Capability without distribution is a hobby.

AI enables front-end design/development previously requiring specialized developers. Consultants can now produce interactive visualizations, personalized landing pages, custom tools, and world-class thought leadership at scale.

### Performance Tax Model

Five taxes that degrade AI capability from demonstrated to realized:
1. Outdated Model (x0.80)
2. Insufficient Context (x0.50)
3. Vague Specifications (x0.70)
4. Single-Shot Methodology (x0.60)
5. No Quality Testing (x0.80)

Cascade from 70.9% demonstrated capability to much lower realized capability depending on active taxes.
