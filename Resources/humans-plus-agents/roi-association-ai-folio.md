# AIROI Association - AI Folio

**"The Publishing Engine for Full Stack Consultants"**

Folio is the deployment/publishing layer of the AIROI Association's ecosystem for AI-native consultants. It lets consultants generate code (proposals, websites, product pages) in any LLM and publish it instantly to a custom URL -- no developers, no CMS, no delays.

This document captures the full Folio page plus the linked ecosystem pages (Repertoire, Atelier, and "The Book" / Consultant page) since they form an integrated offering.

# Part 1: Folio - The Publishing Engine

Source: https://roiassociation.ai/ai-folio

## Hero

**"The Publishing Engine for Full Stack Consultants"**

**"Your Entire Web Presence. Code. Paste. Publish."**

Take full control of your website, your proposals, your products, your thought leadership. No developers. No delays. No dependencies. Just you, your expertise, and a publish button.

**Key Metrics:**
- 5 min: From sales call to personalized proposal page
- 20 min: From idea to live product microsite
- 10x: Engagement on interactive vs. static content

## The Demo

**"From Sales Call to Custom Proposal. In Minutes."**

Watch me take a real discovery call and turn it into a personalized, published proposal page -- live.

## The Shift: From Dependent to Sovereign

**The Old Way:**
- Wait for developers
- Fight your CMS
- Pay for every change
- Static pages
- Your website reflects who you _were_

**The Folio Way:**
- Publish yourself
- Code, paste, done
- Iterate infinitely
- Dynamic, personalized
- Your website reflects who you _are_

"Your web presence should move at the speed of your expertise. Now it can."

## Use Case 01: Proposals

**"Send a personalized proposal page before your competitor opens Word."**

The discovery call ends. You have 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes until they forget -- 5 minutes until the urgency fades, the pain dulls, and "let me think about it" becomes the default.

**Traditional Process:**
1. Open a blank doc
2. Try to remember what they said
3. Write, format, rewrite
4. Send 3 days later
5. Hear nothing

**Folio Process:**
1. Paste the call transcript
2. AI extracts insights
3. AI builds customized proposal
4. Copy -> Paste -> Publish
5. Send in 5 minutes

## Use Case 02: Product Pages

**"From idea to live product page. Twenty minutes."**

You wake up with an idea for a new offer. A workshop. A course. A productized service. In the old world, that's 6 weeks of design and development. In the Folio world, it's live before lunch.

**What Could You Launch?**
- Workshop landing page
- Course sales page
- Lead magnet opt-in
- Productized service
- Event registration
- Waitlist page
- Case study
- Pricing page

## Use Case 03: Interactive Content

**"Interactive content used to cost a fortune and take forever."**

Building one interactive element meant writing briefs, hiring designers, finding developers, and waiting weeks. That's why consultants stuck to text posts. The barrier wasn't knowing -- it was cost and time.

## How It Works

**"One engine. Three commands. Code. Paste. Publish."**

**01 - Code:** Generate production-ready code in your LLM -- Claude, ChatGPT, whatever you use. Websites, proposals, product pages.

**02 - Paste:** Drop the code into Folio. No modifications needed. It handles the hosting, the domains, the infrastructure.

**03 - Publish:** One click. Live. Your client sees a custom URL with your work -- not a Google Doc or a PDF attachment.

"You provide the expertise. Your LLM provides the code. Folio makes it live."

## The Ecosystem

**"Start with proven templates. Build your own over time."**

Folio comes with template libraries for the most powerful consulting use cases.

**Overture - Proposal Templates:** Transform discovery calls into decision-ready proposal pages using SPIN extraction + StoryBrand structure.

**Signal - Lead Magnet Templates:** Generate personalized outreach assets for specific prospects -- not generic PDFs that get ignored.

**Repertoire - Project Workflows:** 729 consulting projects across 9 domains, structured for delivery. The complete map of what you can sell.

"Use ours to start. Build your own in Atelier as you master the system."

## Who It's For

**"Built for consultants who refuse to wait."**

- Independent consultants
- Fractional executives
- EOS Implementers
- Vistage Chairs
- Strategy consultants
- Operations consultants
- AI / automation specialists
- Executive coaches
- Agency owners

"If you sell expertise and you're tired of your web presence lagging behind your thinking -- Folio is for you."

# Part 2: Repertoire - The Canon of 729

Source: https://roiassociation.ai/repetoire

## Core Concept

9 Domains. 9 Specialties each. 9 Projects each. Every engagement that every consulting firm on Earth sells -- mapped, structured, and ready to deploy.

**9 x 9 x 9 = 729**

## The Proof: $25,000 in 10 Minutes

A marketing agency charges $25K and takes 6 weeks for a StoryBrand website buildout. The demo shows the entire thing -- customer psychology, brand narrative, design system, custom-coded landing page -- in a single recorded session.

**The Workflow:**
1. **Account Manager** - Gathers business context
2. **Psychology Expert** - Analyzes buyer's dreams, fears, past failures, suspicions, enemies
3. **Brand Story Expert** - Builds narrative using Hero's Journey (character, problem, guide, plan, action, stakes, success)
4. **Creative Director** - Presents 5 design aesthetics: color palettes, typography, vibe
5. **Lead Developer** - Writes complete website: HTML, CSS, JS, animations, mobile-responsive

Agency charges $25,000 over 6-8 weeks. This does it in 10 minutes.

## The Wedge: Everyone You Know Needs This

Most business websites suffer from:
1. Poorly Messaged - Nobody did the strategy work
2. Badly Designed - Template or dated custom
3. Old - Built years ago, never touched
4. Expensive - Cost too much to build or change
5. Inflexible - Locked into a template or developer

**The Old Tradeoff:**
- Option A (Custom Build): Beautiful but frozen. $15K-50K upfront. Need a developer for every change.
- Option B (Template/WordPress): Editable but constrained. Affordable but generic, always fighting the theme.

**The AI Reality:** The AI _is_ the backend. Custom design, generated in minutes. Need a change? Ask, regenerate, done. No CMS to maintain. No theme to fight. No developer on retainer. The website becomes a living document, not a static asset.

## The Pattern: Every Professional Service

| Service | Old Constraint | New Reality |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Content | Quality OR volume | now both |
| Proposals | Custom OR fast | now both |
| Research | Deep OR broad | now both |
| Training | Personalized OR scalable | now both |
| Analysis | Thorough OR timely | now both |
| Contracts | Custom OR fast | now both |

Every professional service was priced around a constraint that no longer exists. The firms that built their models on those tradeoffs are now over-engineered for a problem that's been solved.

The website is the wedge -- the one project you can lead with in every single engagement. Deliver the website. Get inside. Then sell the other 728.

## Three Delivery Tiers

**Tier 1: DIY** - You guide. They execute. Workflows + guidance. Client runs the play.

**Tier 2: Done With You** - You collaborate. They learn. Shared execution. Client builds the muscle.

**Tier 3: Done For You** - You deliver. They receive. Full delivery. Client gets the outcome.

**729 x 3 = 2,187** -- One menu. Three delivery modes. Priced to fit.

## The Economics

**Old Model:** Agency sends a team for 6 weeks. Client pays $40,000. You can't compete.

**New Model:** You deploy the same engagement in one session. Client pays $5,000. You keep 100% of the margin.

The big firms are trapped. They have overhead. Junior staff. Office leases. Partner comp structures that require massive engagements. You don't.

## Growth Path

- **Day 1:** Master your 9 projects in your specialty. Revenue potential: $90K-$225K.
- **Day 90:** Add a neighbor specialty. Revenue potential: $180K-$450K (18 projects).
- **Year 1:** Own the entire domain. Revenue potential: $810K-$2M+ (81 projects).

# Part 3: Atelier - The AI Builders Studio

Source: https://roiassociation.ai/atelier

## Core Pitch

**"The AI Builders Studio for Consultants"**

**"The Tipping Point Is Here. Learn to Build."**

The capability threshold just crossed. What took teams and months now takes you and an afternoon. The consultants who learn to build software now will own the next decade.

Atelier is where you learn. Watch me build. Get everything I build. Build alongside others.

## The Confession (from Steve, Founder of AIROI)

"I run an AI company. I teach AI transformation to consultants and executives. I've spent years helping others leverage these tools.

And until three weeks ago, I couldn't ship a SaaS app.

Not a real one. Not with user authentication. Not with a database. Not deployed to the internet where actual humans could use it.

I could prototype. I could demo. I could get 80% of the way there.

But that last 20%, the part that turns a demo into a product, required developers. Required time. Required budget.

Then something changed.

The models got better. The tooling caught up. The tipping point arrived.

Now I build complete, deployed, production-ready SaaS applications in a single sitting. Before lunch. With no code experience.

A phase transition.

And most people don't realize it happened yet."

## The Shift

"The capability curve went vertical. Most people missed it."

For years, AI could help you draft emails and summarize documents. Useful, but incremental. Then, in the span of weeks, it crossed a threshold. Now it can build production software. The gap between "can help" and "can do" just collapsed.

## The Proof

Three SaaS apps. Built in one night. By one person. Alone.

Production applications with user authentication, databases, and real users. Each built in under 30 minutes. Total time: 75 minutes.

**What This Proves:** The barrier between "idea" and "shipped product" no longer requires a development team.

**What This Means:** Consultants can now build custom tools for clients, not just recommend them.

**Why Now:** The window is open. The people who learn this now will have an insurmountable head start.

## The Strategic Play: Micro-Assets

**"The consultants who figure this out first will own their clients."**

Through infrastructure.

When you can build a client a custom pipeline tracker, a reporting dashboard, a workflow tool -- in an afternoon -- you stop being a vendor. You become embedded.

These are **micro-assets**. Small, custom software solutions built for individual clients. They weren't economically viable before. Too expensive to build for one client. Now they're trivial to create.

Every micro-app you build is a container. A place where AI agents will eventually live, acting on behalf of your client, using the tools you created.

**Consultant Who Advises:**
- Delivers recommendations
- Client implements (or doesn't)
- Engagement ends
- Easily replaceable
- Competes on price

**Consultant Who Builds:**
- Delivers working tools
- Client uses them daily
- Relationship deepens
- Becomes infrastructure
- Unfireable

You're not just building software. You're building the operating layer for the next decade.

## What's in the Studio

**Weekly Live Builds:** Every week, a new build, live. Real building, not polished demos.

**Full Code Access:** Every SaaS app created becomes yours. The code, the prompts, the architecture. Fork it, modify it, deploy it for your clients.

**Builder Community:** A private community of consultants learning to build. Share what you're creating, get feedback, see what others are shipping.

**Coaching & Support:** Office hours, Q&A sessions, direct support when you hit walls.

## The Value Stack (All Included)

- Weekly live building sessions
- Full code library access
- Folio publishing engine
- Private builder community
- Office hours & coaching
- Early access to everything
- Prompt libraries & workflows
- Architecture patterns

## Who This Is For

**This Is For You If:**
- You want to productize your expertise into software
- You see the AI shift and want to be ahead of it
- You're willing to learn by doing
- You want to build custom tools for your clients
- You're ready to become unfireable

**This Is Not For You If:**
- You want someone to build things for you
- You're looking for done-for-you solutions
- You don't have time to learn something new
- You're skeptical AI can really do this
- You're comfortable waiting to see what happens

# Part 4: The Full-Stack Consultant (The Book)

Source: https://www.roiassociation.ai/consultant

## Foreword: A Letter from Steve Cunningham (December 2025)

Establishes context: recent AI model releases (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2) crossed a capability threshold. Key claim: "AI now does subject matter expert-level work" but only when provided comprehensive context.

Main thesis: An arbitrage window exists between when AI capability becomes expert-level and when it becomes industry standard. Those who master "context engineering" during this period gain competitive advantage before the window closes.

The letter announces the AIROI Association, launching with consultant-focused training, with plans to expand to other professions (coaches, accountants, lawyers, etc.).

## Chapter 0: The Summary

### 0.1 - An Invitation
Frames the moment as a career inflection point. Invites readers to transition from specialization to "Full-Stack Consultant" capability -- someone who can operate across domains and scale delivery systematically.

### 0.2 - Why I'm Writing This
Author background: former lawyer, marketer, and agency operator. Two-and-a-half years of hands-on AI integration and training experience across hundreds of companies. Positions the book as practical knowledge from active implementation, not theoretical debate.

### 0.3 - The Thesis: The GDPval Study

References the "GDPval study" (September 2025) -- reportedly the first rigorous blind evaluation of AI performance against credentialed experts across 57 professional domains.

**Win rate progression cited:**
- GPT-4o (2024): 12.4%
- Grok 4 (Q1 '25): 24.3%
- Gemini 2.5 (Q1 '25): 25.5%
- o4-mini (Q2 '25): 27.9%
- o3 (Q2 '25): 34.1%
- GPT-5 (Q3 '25): 38.8%
- Opus 4.1 (Q3 '25): 47.6%
- GPT-5.2 (Dec '25): 70.9%

The 50% threshold marks a phase change: below parity, AI functions as draft accelerant (requires expert review); above parity, AI produces expert-quality output directly, shifting the constraint from expertise to context provision.

### 0.4 - The Opportunity: AI Arbitrage Window

The gap between demonstrated capability (under ideal conditions with comprehensive context) and realized capability (under typical user conditions with vague prompts). Early adopters who master context engineering operate at demonstrated levels; others operate at degraded performance (~10-20% of potential).

Timeline emphasis: window measured in months, not years. Early advantage compounds before laggards catch up.

### 0.5 - The Unlock: APQC Process Classification Framework

The APQC framework organizes enterprises into 13 functional categories:

**Operating Functions (5):** Strategy, Products, Marketing, Logistics, Services

**Support Functions (8):** Support/Customer Service, HR/Human Capital, IT, Finance, Assets, Risk/Compliance, Partners/External Relationships, Operations/Business Capabilities

Pre-tipping point: consultants operated competently in 1-2 domains due to expertise constraints. Post-tipping point: AI produces expert-quality output across all domains if proper context is provided. The limiting factor becomes context engineering capability, not domain expertise.

**Critical boundary:** This does not override regulatory/licensure requirements (legal advice, financial certification, medical treatment). The expansion applies to advisory, strategic, and operational work.

### 0.6 - The Demand: Buy, Rent, or Build

Companies choose to:
- **Buy:** Hire full-time employees with AI fluency
- **Rent:** Engage consultants offering AI-augmented services
- **Build:** Train existing workforce internally

Most enterprises rent first, using consultants to prove the model before investing internally.

**Large enterprises face the "Coordination Tax":** Functions organized in silos create handoff delays. Full-Stack Consultants operate across functions, bypass coordination overhead.

**Small companies face the "Capability Tax":** Cannot afford full-time specialists in every function. Full-Stack Consultants provide right-sized capability on demand.

### 0.7 - The Path: Three Skills + Five Stages

**Three core skills:**
- **Creative Thinking:** Identifying where AI applies, imagining new workflows
- **Critical Thinking:** Evaluating AI output quality against standards
- **Systems Thinking:** Connecting individual workflows into scalable delivery systems

**Five maturity stages (UCASE):**
1. **Understanding:** Examine current process, learn AI capabilities in domain
2. **Codification:** Document as Standard Operating Procedure
3. **Augmentation:** Rebuild SOP with context engineering principles; AI augments human workflow
4. **Securing:** Add guardrails, edge cases, exceptions; non-experts can execute reliably
5. **Execution:** Convert to autonomous agent operating within defined parameters

### 0.8 - The Deliverables: Three-Tier Model

13 project areas (mapped to APQC functions) correspond to actual client deliverables.

- **DIY (Do It Yourself):** ~$2,000. Client executes using templates/frameworks. Scales infinitely.
- **DWY (Done With You):** ~$10,000. Consultant transfers capability while delivering outcomes.
- **DFY (Done For You):** ~$50,000+. Consultant handles everything; client receives finished work.

Same underlying capability, packaged three ways for different market segments.

### 0.9 - The Engine: Distribution

Recent tipping point: front-end design/development now accessible via AI. Consultants can produce world-class interactive visualizations, data tools, and custom applications from text descriptions. Enables thought leadership at scale.

## Interactive Visualizations on the Page
