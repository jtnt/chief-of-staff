# Steve Cunningham ("AI Steve")

## Summary

Steve Cunningham is the founder of Humans+Agents (formerly Simple Academy) and creator of a system for running businesses via AI using markdown files as agent skills. He spent 12 years running a digital marketing agency, read 3,650+ business books over a decade, and founded Readitfor.me (a book summary platform backed by billionaire investors). When ChatGPT disrupted his core business in late 2022, he dismantled the old model and rebuilt around AI-native operations, growing Simple Academy into a seven-figure business training thousands on AI transition.

## Core Philosophy

Steve treats "AI like a company, not a tool." His tagline: "AI destroyed my business. Then I rebuilt it. You can too." He focuses on the "Humans+Agents Economy" -- helping executives understand and execute strategies where humans and AI agents work together. He emphasizes eternal business problems (making more money, saving time, reducing risk, communicating clearly) rather than chasing tool trends.

## The Operating System / Folder Architecture

This is the system most relevant to us. Steve structures his AI workflow as an organizational operating system:

### Folder Structure
- **Root "Operate" folder** containing everything
- **COO file** -- a master onboarding document for every AI session. He begins each session by telling the AI: "Go read the COO folder and get yourself onboarded."
- **Functional folders** -- Marketing, Sales, Product, etc.
- **Inside each function:**
  - Advisors (decision-making frameworks)
  - Agents (task execution instructions)
  - Context files (brand voice, strategy docs)
  - Design System
  - Templates
  - Projects folder

### Operational Method
1. Each session starts by having the AI read the COO folder for onboarding
2. The agent navigates to relevant department folders
3. It absorbs context files and executes with full business awareness
4. Daily wrap-ups document accomplishments, improvements made, and recommended enhancements
5. The AI implements improvements overnight, creating compounding daily gains

### Key Innovations
- **The Invoice Method:** After completing work, he generates "receipts" showing estimated external costs. Example: 30 minutes of AI work replaced $14,000 and 70 man-hours of agency labor on interface design.
- **HTML as Universal Format:** Advocates HTML as "the language that works for both large language models and human beings" -- enabling instant publishing without CMS friction. He designs entire platform interfaces as HTML files generated by Claude Cowork.
- **Continuous Improvement Loop:** Daily documentation of what was accomplished, what systems improved during work, and what enhancements to make next. Compounding daily.

## Three Strategic Priorities

Steve identifies three things that matter for sustained advantage when AI makes creation costs approach zero:

1. **Distribution** -- Building audience matters more than production capability
2. **Deployment Cycles** -- Operating in perpetual beta, shipping feedback-driven improvements overnight
3. **Data** -- Proprietary intelligence tracking how work gets completed becomes competitive moat
