# Zachery Glass Claude Code Configuration Repository

**Author:** Zachery Glass | **Published:** GitHub repository

## Summary

A popular Claude Code configuration repository (461 stars) demonstrating how to effectively customize Anthropic's CLI tool for development workflows. Showcases settings.json patterns, pre-tool-use hooks, permission management, and statusline customization.

## Key Points

- **settings.json** - Core configuration for permissions, model preferences, environment variables, and security settings
- **Pre-tool-use hooks** - Validation logic for commit messages, GitHub issue integration guards, and critical file protection
- **Statusline customization** - PowerShell script showing project folder, active model, git branch status, and uncommitted changes
- **Permission management** - Granular access controls balancing safety with development efficiency
- **Privacy-first design** - Disables non-essential telemetry while optimizing for workflow

## Why Saved

Reference implementation for Claude Code configuration patterns, particularly useful for understanding hook architecture and permission management. Could inform improvements to Chief of Staff's own Claude Code setup.
